<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>This is not a guide-book, or a history, or a study of
manners and customs. It is a plain story of official
life for more than thirty years. It does not compete
with any of the books already written about Burma,
except, perhaps, the monumental work of General
Fytche. While pursuing as a rule a track of
chronological order, I have not hesitated to wander
into by-paths of dissertation and description. I
could not write without attempting to give fragmentary
impressions of the people and their
character. As far as possible I have limited my
narrative to events within my own knowledge; my
judgments are based on my own observation.</p>

<p>I have to express my acknowledgments to the
friends who have given me photographs to illustrate
the book. My special thanks are due to Mr. A.
Leeds, I.C.S. (retired), for a large number of
characteristic and charming pictures.</p>

<h2><a name="NOTE" id="NOTE">NOTE</a></h2>

<p>Burmese words are spelt according to the Government system
of transliteration. Consonants have the same power as in
English. <i>Y</i> after <i>g</i> combines to form a sound approximating to
<i>j</i>: <i>gyi</i> = “jee”; after every other consonant it is short&mdash;<i>my̆o</i>.
<i>Yw</i> is pronounced “yu.” Vowels and diphthongs have the
sounds given below:</p>

<table summary="Pronouciation">
<tr><td class="tdr"><i>a</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
<td class="tdh"><i>a</i> in “Ma.”</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdr"><i>e</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
<td class="tdh"><i>a</i> in “bane.”</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdr"><i>è</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
<td class="tdh"><i>e</i> in French “père,” without any sound of <i>r</i> following.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdr"><i>i</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
<td class="tdh"><i>ee</i> in “feet.”</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdr"><i>o</i> or <i>ô</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
<td class="tdh"><i>o</i> in “bone.”</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdr"><i>u</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
<td class="tdh"><i>oo</i> in “fool.”</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdr"><i>au</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
<td class="tdh"><i>ow</i> in “cow.”</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdr"><i>ai</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
<td class="tdh"><i>i</i> in “line.”</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdr"><i>ei</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
<td class="tdh"><i>ei</i> in “vein.”</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdr"><i>aw</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
<td class="tdh"><i>aw</i> in “law.”</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Every letter, except <i>y</i> after <i>g</i>, is sounded separately, including
final vowels. Thus, <i>lu-gale</i> is pronounced “loo-ga-lay.” These
instructions are crude and unscientific, and may excite the
derision of purists. They will enable anyone to pronounce
Burmese words with some approach to correctness. In the case
of Shan names I have as a rule adopted the Burmese forms
rather than the Shan forms in official use, which no one who
does not know the language can pretend to pronounce properly.</p>

INTRODUCTORY: A RETROSPECT AND SOME
COMPARISONS</h2>

<p>Burma is a Province of the Indian Empire. It is
not, as some suppose, a Crown Colony administered
directly under the Colonial Office. Nor is it, as
others do vainly talk, a foreign State where Britain
is represented by Consuls. It is the largest, yet
the least populous, of Indian Provinces, more extensive
even than undivided Bengal. The estimated
area is over two hundred and thirty thousand square
miles, larger than either France or Germany. According
to the last census (1911), the population is
about twelve millions. On the west, its seaboard
washed by the Bay of Bengal, Burma marches with
Bengal, Assam, and Manipur; on the east, with
China, French Indo-China, and Siam. To the north,
it stretches, through tracts unadministered and unexplored,
to the confines of Tibet. The mass of the
people are Burmans, a Mongol race akin to Chinese
and Siamese. Other races in Burma are Talaings,
scattered over the Irrawaddy Delta and the Tenasserim
division; Shans, who occupy the great plateau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
on the east and are also found in the northern districts;
Karens, whose home is Karenni, but who are widely
spread over Lower Burma; Kachins, people of the
hills on the north-east; and Chins, of many clans,
inhabiting the hill-country on the north-west
border.</p>

<p>From the middle of the eighteenth century
Burma was ruled by the dynasty of Alaungpaya,
corruptly called Alompra. Alaungpaya seems to
have been a Dacoit chief who began his career at
Shwebo,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and made himself master of the whole
country. In his time the Burmese were a warlike
people, withstanding the might of China, and
carrying their victorious standards into Siam. Ten
Princes<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of his House ruled over the whole, or part,
of his kingdom. In 1826, after the First Burmese
War, the Provinces of Tenasserim and Arakan were
annexed by the East India Company, the central
block from the sea to Tibet remaining under the
Burmese King. In 1852 the Province of Pegu was
conquered. In 1862 Pegu, Tenasserim, and Arakan
were combined to form the Province of British
Burma, and placed in charge of a Chief Commissioner
directly responsible to the Government of
India. In 1885 occurred the Third Burmese War.
Early in 1886, Upper Burma, all that remained
under native rule, was incorporated in the British
Empire. Burma continued to be administered by
a Chief Commissioner till 1897, when the first
Lieutenant-Governor was appointed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>These elementary facts are recorded for the
benefit of any who may be thankful for geographical
and historical information about distant dependencies
of the Crown. We all know the story of
Cape Breton. Most of us have met people who
think that our connection with Burma began in
1885; that Burma regiments are manned by Burman
sepoys; that, to cite an alien instance, Bengalis
serve in the Indian Army. Even what was long
regarded as the mythical confusion of Burma with
Bermuda was seriously printed in a London weekly
last year, and all the newspapers told how an
officer who entered the Army in 1886 served in the
<i>Second</i> Burmese War. Errors like these justify the
platitudes of the preceding paragraphs.</p>

<p>When I first became acquainted with Burma, the
system of administration was comparatively simple.
The Province consisted of three divisions, each
under a Commissioner. Subordinate to the Commissioner
were Deputy Commissioners, each in
charge of a district. Under the Deputy-Commissioner
were subdivisional and township officers, in
charge respectively of subdivisions and townships.
These jurisdictions still remain. In those distant
days townships were further divided into circles,
the territorial unit of administration, constituted
primarily for revenue purposes. Each circle was in
charge of a Taik Thugyi,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> a native official of position
and dignity and often of considerable wealth.
The Taik Thugyi collected capitation tax and land
and fishery revenue, the main sources of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Provincial income, and received a substantial commission
on the returns. Except as a tax-collector,
he had no statutory powers. But he was the chief
man in his circle, and, if of strong character, exercised
great influence. Every village had its headman,
called the Kye-dan-gyi,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> with onerous duties
and incommensurate powers and emoluments. In
recent years circle and village organization has been
reformed. Taik Thugyis have been abolished or
are in course of abolition. The village is now the
administrative unit. The Ywa Thugyi<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> is the local
judge and magistrate, with extensive powers and a
respectable position.</p>

<p>Except of purely Imperial offices, such as Post
and Telegraphs, the Commissioner was the head of
all Departments in the division. As Sessions Judge
he was also the chief judicial officer. In like
manner the Deputy Commissioner controlled every
branch of the administration in his district. The
bulk of petty revenue, criminal, and civil work was
done by Assistant Commissioners, Extra Assistant
Commissioners,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and My̆o-ôks,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> in charge of subdivisions
and townships. Most of the Extra Assistants
and all the My̆o-ôks were natives of Burma.
I think it is true that early in 1878 no Burmese
officer exercised higher powers than those of a
third-class magistrate, and not one was in charge
of a subdivision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>The judicial administration was controlled by a
Judicial Commissioner, who was the High Court
for the whole country except Rangoon, and who
was always deputed from another Province. When
I joined, the late Mr. J. D. Sandford was Judicial
Commissioner. In Rangoon the reins of justice
were in the strong hands of the Recorder (the late
Mr. C. J. Wilkinson). The Judicial Commissioner
and the Recorder sat together in a quaint tribunal
called the Special Court, which heard appeals from
the decisions of each of its members. When the
Judges of the Special Court failed to agree, a
difficult position occurred. The High Court at
Calcutta exercised anomalous jurisdiction in certain
cases. Except the Judicial Commissioner, the
Recorder, the Judge of Moulmein, and a Small
Cause Court Judge or two, there were no officers
occupied exclusively with judicial work. All exercised
judicial and executive functions. Divisional,
Sessions, District, Subdivisional, and Township
Judges, who now flourish in luxuriant abundance,
were not even in the bud.</p>

<p>The rank and file of the police were mostly
Burmans, with some admixture of Indians not of
a very good class. The superior officers, District
and Assistant Superintendents, were men of experience,
well acquainted with the people. A few
military officers still remained in the civil police,
Major T. Lowndes<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> being Inspector-General. Perhaps
the best-known of the British officers were
Messrs. Perreau, Fforde, Jameson, and Dixon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Major C. A. Munro. The Burmese officers&mdash;inspectors
and head constables&mdash;were all men who
had risen from the ranks. Every one of them had
to enlist as a constable and work his way upward.
The system was not without merit, and was well
suited to the idiosyncrasy of the Burmese race.
One distinguished Talaing officer held the rank of
Superintendent of Police, though without a district
charge. This was Maung Shwe Kyi, who was a
King on the Siamese border at Kawkareik. One
of the bravest and most resolute of men, his good
service was recognized by his inclusion in the first
list of Companions of the Order of the Indian
Empire. His son carries on the tradition of his
family.</p>

<p>The Forest Department was in its early lusty
youth vigorously directed by a single Conservator,
Mr. B. Ribbentrop,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> assisted by a small but very
able staff. Burmese teak had long been a staple
product of great value; its care and development
were the main duties of forest officers. The forest
law was, and still remains, complex, logical, meticulous.
I venture the humble suggestion that its
exceeding obscurity may be due to the nationality
of the pioneers of forest administration in India.
We were taught forestry by Germans of great
ability and high scientific attainments, who framed
the statutes of their department as if they were
metaphysical treatises. They created a great and
efficient branch of the administration. But they
enveloped its principles in a mist which baffles the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
ordinary lay intelligence, and can be pierced only by
the philosophic mind, made, or at least trained, in
Germany.</p>

<p>Supreme over all was the Chief Commissioner
(then Mr. Rivers Thompson<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>), assisted by a small
but capable secretariat, which worked for long hours
in a small office on the Strand Road in Rangoon.
The Secretary, Major C. W. Street, was a military
civilian of character and ability. The Junior Secretary
was Mr. R. H. Pilcher, C.S., who had been
Assistant Resident in Mandalay, and was most learned
in the Burmese and Shan tongues. My old friend,
Mr. G. C. Kynoch, was Assistant Secretary. None
of these survives.</p>

<p>The higher officers entrusted with the general
administration, as distinct from special branches,
constituted the Commission. In the Commission
were included the Chief Commissioner, Judicial
Commissioner, Commissioners, Deputy Commissioners,
and Assistant Commissioners. It was composed
of Indian civilians, officers of the Indian Staff
Corps, and uncovenanted<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> officers. Civilians were
few in number. Burma was not considered of
sufficient importance to have men assigned to it
after the open competitions. Men were sent thither
for their sins, either permanently or for a term of
years. A Chief Commissioner’s wife is said to have
told one of these young men that other Provinces
sent their worst men to Burma. However this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
may be, no doubt Burma was regarded as a place of
banishment, a dismal rice-swamp (or, as was once
said, a howling paddy<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>-plain), where the sun never
shone. I remember, while still in London, the commiseration
expressed with one of our seniors whose
deportation to this dreary land was announced.
All this was fiction, falser than the Roman’s conception
of Britain. I found Burma a bright and
pleasant land, green and forest-clad, with a climate
healthier on the whole than the average climate of
Indian plains; its people singularly human, cheerful,
and sympathetic; its officers of all ranks companionable
and friendly. My own considered opinion is
that, in many respects, Burma was one of the best
provinces for a public servant. It is true that, at
first, with only British or Lower Burma open to us,
with but little variety of climate, we were rather
cribbed and confined. The rains, lasting from May
to October, began to pall about the middle of
August. Fungus growth on boots was displeasing.
The Province was (it still is) expensive, and promotion
was slow. It took Sir Harvey Adamson and
myself, who were contemporaries, over seven years
to get a step of substantive rank. But there were
compensations in the lightness of the work (except
in the Secretariat), in the charm and attractiveness
of the people, in the excellent good-fellowship of our
brother-officers, in the hope that before long we
should be in Mandalay, and that united Burma
would give ample scope and opportunity. Burmese
cheroots, too, cost only eightpence a hundred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the military civilians were men of conspicuous
ability, trained in the school of Sir Arthur
Phayre, whose name is still reverenced throughout
Burma, and who stands in the first class of Indian
statesmen and administrators. Many of them had
taken an active part in the pacification of Pegu
after the Second War, and were thoroughly familiar
with the Province and its people, their language
and customs. I yield to none in high appreciation
of the men of my own Service. They have done
as good work in Burma, and have got as near to the
people, as any men in India. But military civilians
also have maintained to this day an honourable
record, and have furnished to the Commission many
valuable officers. I was just too late to know
Colonel David Brown (Brown-gyi<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>), whose memory
still lives in the Province. Colonel Horace Browne,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
Colonel A. G. Duff, Captain C. H. E. Adamson,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
Colonel W. C. Plant, are among the notable soldier-civilians
of my early service. Other officers, afterwards
well-known, were Mr. de Courcy Ireland,
the first officer of his Service in India to become a
commissioner; Mr. A. H. Hildebrand,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the first
Superintendent of the Shan States; and Johnny
Davis, of Papun, whose knowledge of Burma and
the Burmese was unique. When I joined, all the
divisions were in charge of military officers, and
with one or two exceptions, military and uncovenanted
officers ruled every district.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1878 there was one line of railway, 160 miles
in length, from Rangoon to Prome on the Irrawaddy.
To and from Toungoo, a station on the Burmese
frontier, the journey had to be made by way of the
Sittang River, and occupied about a fortnight.
Once upon a time, a man started from Toungoo
with a friend. They travelled in separate boats, in
one of which was stored all the provisions for the
voyage. The commissariat boat started first, and
my man never saw his friend again till he reached
Rangoon. For a fortnight he had to subsist on
such scanty fare as he could pick up on the river-bank.
When I saw him soon afterwards, he was
perceptibly thinner and still full of wrath. Toungoo
is now on the Mandalay line, and is reached in a
few hours. There are 1,529 miles of railways in
Burma; lines to Mandalay, to Myit-kyi-na in the
extreme north, to Alôn on the Chindwin, to Moulmein,
one of our ports, to Lashio in the Northern
Shan States, in mid-air on the way to China, to
Bassein and Henzada in the Delta. The sea-borne
trade has made immense progress. In 1878 it
was valued at £15,684,920; in 1911 at nearly
£43,000,000.</p>

<p>The garrison consisted of two battalions of British
infantry, one of which gave a detachment to the
Andamans, five Madras regiments, and five batteries
of artillery. Troops were stationed at Rangoon, on
the frontier at Toungoo and Thayet-myo, and at
Moulmein. There were no troops in Arakan.
There were no military police. The Province was in
a state of profound peace, though there were occa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>sional
dacoities on the borders, and, as always,
Tharrawaddy had a bad name.</p>

<p>Of Rangoon in those early days, separate mention
may be made. One glory it had which still abides.
The Shwe Dagôn Pagoda, most sacred and most
illustrious of pure Buddhist shrines, dominating the
landscape, rose golden to the sky. From far the
traveller approaching Rangoon from the sea caught
sight of that amazing shaft of gold, and instinctively
did reverence. In the bright winter sunshine, in
the blue haze of summer heat, in the veiled mysteries
of tropic moonlight, it towered awe-inspiring, stupendous,
divine. On feast days and sabbaths the
platform was thronged with worshippers, surely the
brightest, best-humoured, most laughter-loving of
all pious crowds. Even now one can imagine no
scene more gracious, more mystically serene and
lovely, than the pagoda in the light of the full
moon, when all that is tawdry and unseemly is
charmed away. But thirty years ago, before the
platform was covered with modern shrines not all in
harmony with æsthetic canons, it was still more
gravely and austerely beautiful.</p>

<p>In recent years the erection of new buildings on
the pagoda platform, already overcrowded, has been
forbidden. This probably is wise and right. Being
in the centre of a fort, with an arsenal in close
proximity, the pagoda is in military custody. The
presence of the arsenal is a menace to the safety of
this famous shrine. A serious explosion would
shatter the fabric and irreparably destroy one of
the wonders of the world. The pagoda would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the natural place of refuge in time of serious disturbance.
For this reason, among others, the continuance
of military control is essential. But the
removal of the arsenal to a distance is an urgent
necessity.</p>

<p>After its occupation in 1852, Rangoon was carefully
laid out on a systematic plan, with straight
streets of varying width. The broadest road, edged
with shady trees, ran from Soolay Pagoda up to the
cantonment, as fine a thoroughfare as could be seen
in East or West. In the early fifties some far-seeing
benefactor planted along Godwin Road<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> a
glorious avenue of padauk, and earned the blessings
of men later born. Three times, at the approach of
the rains, these stately trees burst forth for a day
in petals as beautiful and as fleeting as fairy gold.
Then one drives under a canopy of gold, over a
golden carpet of fallen flowers, amidst a crowd each
bearing a golden blossom. To see this lovely sight
you must live in Burma. It comes too late in the
season for the casual visitor.</p>

<p>The main lines of the plan of Rangoon have been
preserved, and are as at first designed. But the
past thirty years have seen many changes. In 1878,
though there were many strangers within its borders,
Rangoon was still a Burmese town. Now it is the
third port in the Indian Empire,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> a vast city of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
over a quarter of a million of people, speaking a
pentecostal variety of tongues, among whom
Burmans are a dwindling minority. Then the
cantonment, no doubt of needlessly vast extent,
occupying a wide space on every side of the pagoda,
was like a picturesque park, studded with little
wooden houses, each surrounded by an ample shady
garden. Halpin Road, by some sentimentalists
called the Ladies’ Mile, with a humble but select
gymkhana<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> at one end, was restricted to the use
of the military and civil community. Now the
gymkhana has been quadrupled in size, and far more
than quadrupled in membership. Jehus of all races
and classes raise the dust of Halpin Road in dogcarts,
landaus, and motor-cars. A great modern
hotel occupies a large space; houses of a decadent
type, planted as close together as suburban villas,
have devastated the pretty cantonment; natives
of wealth and position live on sites once reserved
for the sovereign race. Doubtless all these are
signs of progress. But they shock the æsthetic
sense. The Pegu Club was housed in Cheape Road,
in a wooden building not long ago dismantled. On
the Royal Lake a few boats afforded exercise and
pastime. If your boat upset, you were fined for
illegal bathing; and if you scrambled back into
your boat, you were fined for embarking elsewhere
than at the prescribed jetty. Dalhousie Park, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
may be gratefully admitted, has been much improved,
mainly by the devoted attention of the late
Mr. John Short. It is now beyond imagination the
home of the picturesque, its lovely lawns and winding
paths fringing the lake, with the pagoda shining
in the middle distance. Except a few public offices,
there were no buildings of importance. Government
House was of wood, with a small masonry annexe,
near the present imposing and luxurious, but hardly
beautiful structure. A neighbouring house was
used as a guest-house, to accommodate the overflow
of visitors, till some years later it was sold by a
frugal Chief. The General Hospital, of wood
saturated with generations of microbes, was then,
and for long after, a disgrace to civilization. It
has now been replaced by a magnificent pile, the
best-equipped hospital in the East, one of the best-equipped
in the world. The race-course, round the
parade ground, was about two-thirds of its present
size. The little race-meetings twice a year, where
one knew all the ponies and riders, when lotteries
were of small value and attended by one’s friends
and acquaintances, when bookmakers were unknown,
and we did our mild gambling at the totalizator,
were more enjoyable and more truly sporting than
the present-day monthly meetings, where more than
half the owners are Chinamen or Indians, and
almost all the riders professional jockeys. In
wealth, in luxury, in comfort, Rangoon has made
great advances in the last thirty years. Yet I
doubt if it is quite as pleasant a place of abode as it
was a generation ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>The outskirts of Rangoon were rustic or, as we
say, jungly. About this time a tiger swam across
the river from Dalla, then a mere village, and was
shot by Mr. G. G. Collins, an Inspector of Police,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
under a house in Godwin Road. Within the last
ten years a similar incident occurred. One morning
an old woman, selling cheroots on the pagoda platform,
half asleep or half blind, opened her eyes, and
saw in the dim dawn moving near her stall what
she took to be a large cat. She waved it away, and
it went off. It was a tiger which had strolled up
the grassy slope of the Pagoda Hill. The pagoda
was being regilt, and was encased in lattice-work.
The tiger climbed half-way up the trellis and there
stopped, till, after some ineffectual attempts, it was
shot by an officer of the garrison. This strange
event has an explanation. A nat<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> came riding on
the tiger to inspect the gilding of the pagoda. He
rode half-way up and then dismounted, pursuing
his journey on foot. On his return, he was much
surprised and displeased to find that his steed had
been killed. Some say that he was unable to
resume his journey, and is still there. This story
was current in Rangoon on the evening of the
occurrence.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
EARLY YEARS AND FIRST IMPRESSIONS</h2>

<p>My personal acquaintance with Burma dates from
January, 1878. I came to India as a Bengal
civilian, attached to the Upper Provinces, liable
to serve in the North-West Provinces, the Punjab
and Oudh. It was doubtless for that reason and
because I had shown some aptitude for the study
of Persian that the Government of India were
pleased to post me to the Central Provinces, and
then, before I had even joined at Nagpúr, to order
me to Burma. As in those days our covenants did
not bind us to serve elsewhere than in the Province
of our choice, I think it likely that, after a term
in Burma, I might have obtained a transfer to the
North-West Provinces. However, I went to Burma
and stayed there; and so far as my official career
is concerned, I do not suppose I should have done
as well in any other part of India. Certainly I
should not have had elsewhere so interesting a life,
or found so congenial a people.</p>

<p>On our arrival in Rangoon, my wife and I were
hospitably received by two residents, Mr. E. C.
Morrieson, a man of my own year, and Mr. C. F.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Egerton Allen, then Government Advocate, afterwards
acting Recorder of Rangoon, and still later
in the House as member for Pembroke Boroughs.
Their kindness was in accordance with the traditions
of the country, which, I am glad to say, are still
maintained. A comparatively new Province, in
some respects it may be a little behind the times,
Burma has always cherished the primitive virtues,
conspicuously that of hospitality. Perhaps to some
extent this is ascribable to the influence of the
<i>genius loci</i>. For in the world there are no kinder
or more hospitable people than the Burmese. The
generous manner in which strangers are received
may be one reason why hotels in Burma have, if
possible, a worse repute than those of India.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Our first station was Bassein, one of the four
ports of Burma, situated on a fair river some sixty
miles from the sea, in the midst of the Delta of the
Irrawaddy. It was then the headquarters of a
district. Not very long afterwards it became the
headquarters of the Irrawaddy division, carved out
of the overworked division of Pegu. In those days
the only approach to Bassein was by river steamer.
Even now, though Bassein is linked with Rangoon
by rail, the river journey is easier and pleasanter.
Our little vessel steamed now on the broad flood
of the main river, now through narrow winding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
channels, called locally “creeks,” which intersect the
delta in countless profusion. Though searchlights
in the bows were then unknown, we ran on, by day
and night, between densely wooded banks. Now
and again the passage was so narrow that branches
of trees crashed through our cabin window. Here
and there, on the mud of a bank left bare by the
tide, we saw crocodiles and bands of chattering
monkeys. Except at the large villages, where we
halted to take up and set down passengers and
cargo, the solitude was perfect save for a few huts
on the riverside, a casual fisherman in his dugout,
a boat full of men and women going to market, or
of monks (pôngyis) in their yellow robes. The
hideous sampan and the still more horrible lighter
or barge had not yet invaded these sacred recesses.
Such larger craft as passed us were the stately
Burmese boats, built on graceful lines, propelled by
sail and oar, with high carved sterns on which the
helmsman sat aloft. Such people as we saw were
all Burmans or Karens. The kala<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> was as rare as
a black swan.</p>

<p>My Deputy Commissioner was Mr. G. D. Burgess,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
one of the first civilians deputed to Burma, of the
same year as the late Sir Denzil Ibbetson, of
lamented memory. Mr. C. U. Aitchison,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
succeeded Mr. Rivers Thompson as Chief Commissioner
early in 1878, visited Bassein this year
in the course of a tour in the old Government
steamer, the <i>Irrawaddy</i>. Recognizing Mr. Burgess’s
rare ability, he called him to Rangoon soon afterwards
to act as secretary in place of Major Street,
who went on leave. This was exceptional promotion
for a man of about eight years’ service. Mr. Burgess
was a man of great capacity, of untiring industry,
of immense power of work, of exceptional mastery
of detail, of singularly sane judgment, one whose
opinion, as Mr. Aitchison said, was always worthy
of consideration. For several years he worked in
the secretariat, afterwards did excellent service as
Commissioner at Mandalay and elsewhere, and in
due course became Judicial Commissioner of Upper
Burma. In that high office he had full scope for
his industry and sound judgment. His rulings,
especially on points of Buddhist law, illuminated
many dark places, and are still cited with respect.
Mr. Burgess’s health was undermined by excessive
work in the secretariat. In 1898 he had to take
leave, and, by a melancholy accident, died at sea
on his way home. He was one of the ablest officers
who ever served in Burma, and, if his health had
not failed, must have risen to the highest posts.
If he had a fault officially, it was a tendency to
interfere too much in detail and to do the work of
his subordinates. No doubt, as Mr. Aitchison used
to say, and as others have often said, the great
administrator is he who does his own duty and sees
that those under him do theirs. But the defect I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
have ventured to note is the defect of a generous
quality.</p>

<p>In those days the education of junior civilians
was left to take care of itself. There was no Land
Records Department and there were no elaborate
circulars prescribing a course of training. What
sort of training a junior officer enjoyed, or whether
he had any training at all, depended entirely on the
quality of his first Deputy Commissioner. I need
hardly say that I regard as preferable the present
system, under which every young officer is passed
through a definite course of practical instruction in
all branches of his work. But even now a great
deal depends on the personality of the Deputy
Commissioner. It was my good fortune to begin
my service under the guidance of an excellent
officer and a high-minded, great-hearted gentleman.
Never had green griffin a kindlier or abler mentor.
And to the end of his life Mr. Burgess treated me
with the kindness of an elder brother. I was
placed in charge of the Treasury; given Third Class
magisterial powers, that is, power to imprison for
one month, fine up to fifty rupees, and, such was
the barbaric darkness of that age, to whip; and
set to try petty criminal cases, learn Burmese, and
prepare for the departmental examinations. I confess
that I had a charmingly idle time. In those
happy days life was not in the least strenuous.
The busiest time was when the head accountant
went sick for about a month, and I had to do his
work as well as my own. In this way I did
thoroughly learn the Treasury system, even if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
forgot it afterwards. The zeal of youth betrayed
me into a somewhat serious blunder, whereby I
incurred the formal censure of Government. This,
though recorded, was never officially communicated
to me, and does not seem to have done me any
harm. I cannot call to mind anything amusing or
interesting in the court or office work. If there are
tales, others must tell them. It was not in Bassein
that a Third Class Magistrate sentenced a cattle-thief
to imprisonment for one week, the normal
sentence then, and, I hope, now being one of two
years’ hard labour. Called upon for justification,
he gravely explained that he had to observe some
measure in his sentences. If he gave a man a whole
month for cattle-theft, what sentence could he pass
if he convicted a man of murder? Nor was it here
that a young magistrate fined a woman Rs. 10,
or in default rigorous imprisonment for two years.
It was elsewhere that an officer fined his own
servant judicially for “spoiling the Court’s soup”
by using an oily cloth to wipe the plates withal.
These stories, current in Burma long ago, are
possibly all invented. Similarly mythical, I suspect,
are the legends of the young civilian who
gratefully accepted advice not to try a long shot,
lest he should strain the gun; of another who on
the voyage out kept under his pillow a revolver
wrapped in paper and labelled “Dangerous”; of a
third who was persuaded to rise at mess, as the
representative of Government, and forestall the
President in announcing the toast of “The Queen.”
But many years later, with my own ears, I heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the health of Her Majesty proposed, “coupled with
the name of General &mdash;&mdash;,” and the gallant General
respond on behalf of his Sovereign.</p>

<p>Bassein was a charming station, with that mingling
of non-official and official society which doth ever
add pleasure. The great rice firms, Messrs. Bulloch
Bros., Messrs. Strang Steel and Co., Messrs. Mohr
Bros., and others, had mills on either side of the
river, and the presence of their representatives
helped to form a festive and sociable community.
We were all young and all cheerful. Though there
was no club, we managed to meet and enjoy life.
Besides an inchoate attempt at polo, then just
coming into vogue, riding in the fields and jungle,
and playing lawn tennis, were the principal amusements.
Golf had not been introduced. I am afraid
ladies had rather a quiet time, for dances were of
very rare occurrence. But bachelor frolics were
many, and the spectacled Deputy Commissioner
who looked grave enough on the Bench was leader
in every frivolity. His Saturday night whist dinners
were often more hilarious than the occasion indicates.
I refrain from recording instances of light-hearted
jests perpetrated from time to time, partly
because they were too trivial for immortality, partly
lest the serious reader think us more childish-foolish
than we were. The survivors of those joyous days
will call to mind many a noisy revel. No harm was
done. Mr. Kipling would have found no copy for
the mildest of plain tales.</p>

<p>There were reminders of historic times. One of
the Public Works officers was a veteran who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
fought at Chillianwallah. Another resident had
learnt his work under Brunel. Less pleasing
relics of the past were a few old men branded
on the forehead and sent into transportation
from India. Some, but not all, were mutineers.
They were not in confinement, but eked out a
wretched existence on two or three pence a day.</p>

<p>I saw something of district life. More than once
the Deputy Commissioner took me on tour with
him, and I had opportunities of learning methods
of sound administration. The Deputy Commissioner
was the head of the district, and, as already stated,
controlled all except the purely Imperial departments.
Even over Forests, Public Works, and
Education he exercised paternal sway. He was
explicitly declared to be the head of the police.
And he was the chief executive officer, with as
much influence as his personality secured. He
cherished his own District Fund, his pet child, and
had a fair amount of money to spend on minor
works. Often he was his own road-maker. As
District Magistrate, with power to try all but
capital offences and impose substantial penalties,
and as District Judge, with unlimited original civil
jurisdiction and wide appellate powers, he directed
the judicial administration.</p>

<p>He constantly travelled slowly through the district,
and was personally known to all the people.
In most districts the volume of work was not
beyond the capacity of an able and energetic officer.
We in Bassein were fortunate in possessing the
ablest Deputy Commissioner in the Province, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
district flourished under his benign and firm rule.
It was an invaluable object-lesson to accompany
Mr. Burgess on tour and mark his procedure.
Always accessible to the humblest villager, yet
strict in upholding the authority of his subordinates,
Myo-ôks and Thugyis; halting here and there to
investigate disputes in revenue matters, to hear
complaints, to try cases; treating the local officials
with kindness and consideration, while preserving
his place and dignity; inspecting village records;
checking capitation tax returns and land revenue
rolls; visiting fields on which remission of revenue
was claimed; taking a day off now and then to shoot
snipe; the Deputy Commissioner’s progress tended
to the happiness of the people and the peace of the
countryside. I have no doubt that this was the
best system of administration ever devised or practised.
The separation of judicial and executive
functions, the curtailment of the Deputy Commissioner’s
powers, the attempt, happily so far not
successful in Burma, to diminish his authority over
the police and his responsibility for peace and order,
are all steps backward; to vary the metaphor, they
are solvents which will gradually destroy the vitality
of the administration and weaken the foundations of
good government laid by our predecessors. I have
no right to speak of other provinces of India. In
Burma there is a comparatively simple social organization.
With a strong feeling of personal independence
and a full measure of self-respect, the people looked
up to the officials and recognized that they were
better off under authority than if they attempted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
govern themselves. Above all, they knew that in
the last resort they could rely on the justice and
firmness of British officers. Under this system the
moral and material welfare of the peasant and
trader was promoted far more surely than by the
introduction of Western methods unsuited to the
idiosyncrasy of the race. Nor does this proposition
preclude Burmans from obtaining by degrees an
ever-increasing share in the offices of the administration.
As qualified men become available, by all
means let them undertake higher duties. But do
not let us try prematurely to impose representative
institutions on people who neither demand nor
understand them. Above all, let us avoid the
pernicious cant of thinking that our mission in
Burma is the political education of the masses.
Our mission is to conserve, not to destroy, their
social organism; to preserve the best elements of
their national life; by the maintenance of peace and
order to advance the well-being of the Burmese
people.</p>

<p>At Bassein, in town and district, I first saw
Burmans at home, and laid the foundations of many
lasting friendships. My first two clerks were
Maung Pe,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and Maung Aung Zan. One has long
been the respected Second Judge of the Small Cause
Court in Rangoon, the Aristides of his race; the
other is the first Burman District Judge. A well-known
character was U Bya, the Judge of the
Bassein Small Cause Court, an officer of age and
dignity, who, it was said, had raised himself to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
honourable rank from the humble position of peon
in the Treasury. Although contact with foreigners
had to some extent begun to affect the Burmese
character, it must be remembered that the time of
which I write was only twenty-five years after
the taking of Rangoon, a shorter period than has
now elapsed since the occupation of Mandalay.
Even in Pegu the Burman was far less sophisticated
than he has become in recent years. The great
rice-plains of the delta were not nearly all under
cultivation. The farmer worked his own moderate
holding with the help of his family and of reapers
who came down annually from Upper Burma. The
inroad of coolies and settlers from Madras and
Bengal not yet begun. The delta was sparsely
peopled, and everyone was happy and contented.</p>

<p>After leaving Bassein, I spent a few weeks in
Rangoon as personal assistant to the Chief Commissioner.
The personal assistant combined the posts
of private secretary and aide-de-camp, without the
emoluments, and with only part of the work of those
offices. Under Mr. Aitchison’s tolerant régime,
the duties were extremely light, and consisted
mainly in ciphering and deciphering telegrams.
By him and by Mrs. (now Lady) Aitchison, we
were treated with unvarying kindness. The days
spent as members of their official family are days
of happy memory. Mr. Aitchison was one of the
first batch of competition walas, and was rightly
regarded as a distinguished ornament of our service.
At a very early stage in his career he became
Foreign Secretary to the Government of India.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
That high office he exchanged for the comparative
obscurity of Burma, only because he differed from
the Viceroy (Lord Lytton) on points of frontier
policy. He was a man of exceptional ability, of
resolute character, with the most delicate sense of
honour, a chief whom it was a pride and pleasure
to serve. The Governor-General being his own
Foreign Minister, Mr. Aitchison had been brought
into close personal relations with every Viceroy<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
who, up to that time, had held office. In his
judgment, among these statesmen, the man of
genius, the one who got most quickly to the root of
a difficult problem, was Lord Lytton. As the two
men were by no means sympathetic, this opinion is
of special value.</p>

<p>We came to Rangoon early in 1879, at a time of
great excitement. The preceding October had seen
the death of Mindôn Min, who ruled the Burmese
kingdom for more than five-and-twenty years.
King Mindôn, or Min-taya-gyi Paya, was an enlightened
monarch, worthy to be placed in the
same class, though not side by side, with Solomon
and Akbar. He wrested the throne from his incapable
brother, Pagan Min, whose headstrong folly
had involved his country in the Second Burmese
War. With rare magnanimity, he neither slew
nor blinded the deposed King, but allowed him
to live in peace in his own house for the rest of his
days. Indeed, Pagan Min survived his successor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Mindôn Min was an able administrator, and quite
master of his kingdom. He held in his own hands
all the threads of government, and kept himself
informed of all that happened even in the remotest
corners. Peace and order were reasonably well
maintained, and projects for developing the resources
of the country were initiated. The teak forests
were opened out by English firms. Many Europeans,
principally French and Italian, were attracted to
his Court, and employed in various capacities.
Among other reforms may be mentioned the levy of
regular taxation on land and incomes, and the payment
of salaries to officials. The practice had been
for an official to be placed in charge of a local area,
which he was expressively said to “eat.” After
paying his dues to Government, he squeezed as
much as possible for himself. In this reign, though
the custom was not abolished, its prevalence was
restricted. The King was a very pious Buddhist, a
generous benefactor of the pagoda at Rangoon, and
a steadfast pillar of his religion. He discouraged
the taking of life, the use of opium, the consumption
of intoxicating liquors. Like Solomon in wisdom,
he rivalled him in the number of his wives. Although
he declined to make a treaty ceding any part of his
dominions to Great Britain, he respected the frontier-line
laid down by Lord Dalhousie, he kept on good
terms with our Government in Lower Burma, and
he had the good sense highly to appreciate Sir
Arthur Phayre. So long as he ruled in Mandalay,
there was no likelihood of any expansion of British
territory at his cost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>The death of Mindôn Min threw the whole of
Upper Burma into confusion. By a palace intrigue,
in which the principal actors were Queen Sinbyumashin
and the Taingda Mingyi,<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> the Thebaw
Mintha,<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> was placed on the throne. King Thebaw
was about eighteen years of age. He seems to
have been a dull youth, of no character, good or
bad. The beginning of his rule was stained by the
murder of most of the sons of Mindôn Min, a
massacre as ruthless and almost as many-headed as
the slaughter of the sons of Ahab. Though the
Princesses were not killed, they were consigned to
captivity. Of the massacre of the Princes, two
extreme views have been held. The young King
has been represented as a monster of cruelty, himself
personally responsible for this atrocity. The
cynical suggestion is that, in Burma as in other
Oriental countries, it was a measure of ordinary
precaution for the King to remove possible rivals
and pretenders; in so doing, Thebaw was no worse
than his predecessors. As a matter of fact, most
likely neither the King nor his much-maligned
Queen had much to do with the massacre. It
was, no doubt, the work of his Ministers, chiefly of
the blood-stained Taingda Mingyi, a name to all
succeeding ages cursed. But it is also the case that
this wholesale butchery, though not without precedent,
was not in accordance with the practice of
Burman Kings, at least, in recent years. Certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
no such deluge of blood sullied the opening days of
King Mindôn. The probable explanation is that
the title of the new King was felt to be precarious,
while his personality did not compensate the insecurity
of his claim. He was not the eldest, nor
the ablest, nor the most popular, of Mindôn Min’s
sons. For these reasons, I conjecture, some of the
Ministers thought it desirable to remove potential
centres of revolt and disaffection. I cannot believe
that my learned and mild-tempered friend, the
Kinwun Mingyi, though nominally the head of the
State Council, approved this savage measure. The
stories current at the time, of the King priming
himself with drink, and personally directing the
slaughter, were certainly false. It is true, however,
that in the early days of his reign King Thebaw
was much under the influence of a titular Prince,
Maung Tôk,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and that these two boon companions
did hold drunken orgies together. After Maung
Tôk’s removal there is no record of intemperance in
the Palace.</p>

<p>The massacre of the sons of Mindôn Min sent a
thrill of horror through the civilized world. Our
Resident at Mandalay, Mr. R. B. Shaw, entered
vehement protests. He also sheltered two Princes,
the Nyaung-yan and Nyaung-ôk Minthas, who
were, I understand, brought to the Residency by
M. d’Avéra, and whose lives were saved by their
despatch to Lower Burma and thence to Calcutta.
In Rangoon the Press and public were loud in condemnation,
and clamorous for action. In the interests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of humanity and civilization the Indian Government
were urgently pressed to intervene. They nearly
did so. Preparations for the despatch of troops
were begun. One regiment, the 43rd Light Infantry,
actually came over from Madras, in hot haste and
with the barest camp kit, and was sent to the
frontier. All its officers expected to be in Mandalay
in a fortnight, and sore was the indignation of the
British regiment in Rangoon that these new-comers
should go to the front while it remained in cantonments.
The Rangoon Regiment had its consolation.
For all their term in Burma the 43rd stayed on the
frontier, and never put a foot across it. The Government
of India were fully occupied with troubles in
Afghanistan, which some few months later culminated
in the murder of Sir Louis Cavagnari at
Cabul. At home, Ministers were staggered by the
disaster of Isandhlwana in February of this year.
Both Governments had their hands too full to find
leisure for upholding the cause of humanity in Upper
Burma. It was a very near thing. Had there not
been pressing affairs elsewhere, we should doubtless
have occupied Mandalay, and almost certainly set
up a protected King. The time was ripe for intervention,
but not for annexation.</p>

<p>At Government House we were kept moderately
busy by telegrams with Mandalay and Calcutta.
One fine morning the Nyaung-yan Prince appeared,
with the design of attempting (to speak proleptically)
a Jameson raid on Upper Burma. The secret history
of this incident I may not tell. Let it suffice to say
that the Prince was sent back to Calcutta with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
speed in a Government ship. To soothe public feeling
in Rangoon a Press <i>communiqué</i> was issued from
the Secretariat, informing the world that in respect
of Upper Burma the attitude of the Government of
India was one of “repose and defence,” a phrase
which was received with mingled surprise and
derision. The explanation I may perhaps disclose
after many years. The telegram of the Government
of India authorizing the announcement was signalled,
or at any rate transcribed by me, in the
words given to the Press. But what the Government
of India wrote was that their attitude was one
of “reserve and defence.” Curiously and perhaps
somewhat ingenuously the Rangoon Volunteer Rifles
adopted, and for many years retained, as their
motto the words “Repose and Defence.” Of late
they have become more energetic, and this motto
has been discarded as inappropriate.</p>

<p>Government House maintained the hospitable
traditions of the Province. All the officers of the
43rd were entertained and housed during their very
brief stay in Rangoon, and, though tourists were
fewer than in later years, we had some visitors. Of
these the most distinguished was General Ulysses
Grant, ex-President of the United States, who in
his voyage round the world touched at Rangoon.
With him came Mrs. Grant, their son Colonel Grant,
a Cabinet Minister, a doctor, and a man of letters.
General Grant seemed to me to talk, in moderation,
as much as other people. I had the honour of being
instructed by him in the mysteries of the constitution
of the United States, and even of discussing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
with him the possibility of a League of Anglo-Saxon
Peoples to impose peace on the world. He impressed
us all as a man of strength, dignity, and character.
The growing port and city of Rangoon interested
him, and he foresaw and foretold its early and rapid
increase. May I tell here a trivial story? At a
reception at Government House in honour of General
Grant, whereat all Rangoon was present, one of the
highest officers brought down the house by withdrawing
a chair on which the Commissioner of Pegu
was about to sit. As the Commissioner weighed
about twenty stone, he was somewhat seriously
annoyed by this frolic, though not, I am glad to
say, hurt. I record the incident, and refrain from
moralizing.</p>

<p>Though wealth has increased and the standard of
living has been raised, there seems to have been
more money to spend in Rangoon in those days.
The great merchants vied with Government House
in their entertainments. One at least left a lasting
impression. More than twenty years after I tried
in vain for some time to explain to my old native
coachman where he was to drive. At last my
meaning dawned on him. “You want to go to
Leishmann Sahib’s house.” Now, Leishmann Sahib
had opened his doors to General Grant, and about a
year later had left Rangoon for ever. Rice and teak
were the sole sources of wealth. The oil-fields were
as yet unexplored. The price of rice had not risen
to its recent fictitious height. There were no
limited companies with opportunities for unlimited
speculation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>About this time the Diocese of Rangoon was
constituted, and Dr. J. H. Titcomb was consecrated
the first Bishop. Coming straight from England,
with no knowledge of the East, Bishop Titcomb’s
inexperience betrayed him into some pardonable
mistakes. Very soon after his arrival, he surprised
some friends with words to this effect: “Though I
have been here such a short time, I regret to say
that already sorrow has visited my household. I
have had to give my cook a week’s leave to bury his
grandmother.” For a cook to ask leave to attend
his grandmother’s funeral is much the same as for
an undergraduate to prefer a similar request in
Derby week. I mean no disrespect to a good man’s
memory by telling this innocent story. The Bishop
won all hearts by his kind and gentle bearing, and
was, I am sure, an excellent occupant of the new
See. He was the first Prelate with whom I was
privileged to play lawn-tennis.</p>

<p>A little earlier had been tried the eccentric experiment
of appointing a Forest Officer to the
charge of the Education Department in the temporary
absence of the Director. The acting Director
played the part of Balaam with a difference. In his
first and last Annual Report, instead of blessing, he
freely cursed the Department and all its works.
Mr. Max Ferrars still flourishes. He has returned
to his early love, and professes literature at a German
University. He will forgive me for exhuming this
early incident of his career. The Education Department,
from time to time, has incurred much obloquy,
for the most part undeserved. Its errors have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
due to want of intimate knowledge of the language
and customs of the people. Certainly it has never
merited the cynical censure, perhaps unwittingly
implied in a Government Resolution which, in removing
an officer as an incorrigible drunkard,
remarked that he might obtain employment in the
Education Department.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
THE FIRST SUBDIVISION: THE SECRETARIAT</h2>

<p>My first subdivision was Pantanaw in the Delta of
the Irrawaddy. The town from which it was named
stands on a narrow creek through which used to
pass the steamers of the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company
plying between Rangoon and Bassein. Long since
the mouth of the creek has silted up. When next
I visited Pantanaw, as Commissioner, I had to
approach the town in a small boat of the shallowest
draft. But, in ’79, the arrival of the Bassein steamer
was the event of the week. Pantanaw is said to be
a Talaing (and portmanteau) word meaning “The
abode of the people who have to use mosquito nets.”
If the Burma Research Society correct this statement,
I must bear it. At any rate, if the etymology
is false, the connotation is true. Burma could show
places where mosquitoes were more numerous and
more valiant, where even cattle had to be put under
nets at night and prisoners in jail protected by iron
gratings. But the mosquitoes of Pantanaw were
plentiful and brave enough. After a short time
one seems to become more or less immune against
ordinary mosquito bites. The new-comer is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
succulent and more attractive to this friendly insect.
It is the song of the creature which is a persistent
annoyance. But the mosquito of these parts has no
curious taste. To the last he bit me as well as sang
in my ears. In those days the local mosquito apparently
was not of the kind which carries malaria.
Or perhaps, owing to the backward state of sanitary
education, he had not yet learned his trade. Cholera
and smallpox excepted, the delta was comparatively
free from serious diseases. Though swampy and
water-logged, it was not beset by malignant fevers.</p>

<p>Our house was humble. In accordance with the
usage of the time, it was built on piles, so that the
rooms were 8 or 10 feet above the ground. Thus
we lived well out of the mud and out of reach of
snakes. An open, slippery, wooden stair ascended
to the doorway. The walls were of mat, and the
roof was of thatch. I am willing to believe that
there was a plank floor, though I have a vague
impression that we trod on split bamboos. The
house consisted of one fairly large room, divided
into two by a mat partition reaching nearly to the
unceiled roof. One part was the bedroom, with a
bathroom attached, the other was a combined dining-
and drawing-room. Tacked on was one more room,
about the size of a three-berth cabin. This was the
study or library. Having mosquito netting over
door and windows, it was habitable even after
sunset. During our sojourn, Government very
kindly began to build a nice new house for us. It
was our Promised Land, of which we had but
a Pisgah-sight. We watched its progress with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
interest, often visiting the work and suggesting
small improvements. We were transferred about
a week before it was finished. I slept in it once,
twenty years after.</p>

<p>Pantanaw was a depot for Ngapi, that malodorous
compound of decayed fish in which Burmans delight.
The public buildings were a courthouse with a
police-station hard by, a hospital, a schoolhouse,
and a bazaar, or market. The rest of the town
consisted of native houses of fishermen, traders, and
brokers. In the dry weather, the foreshore was
covered with huts. Bitter and ceaseless were the
disputes between brokers and traders about claims
to hut-sites on the sands. The streets were causeways
of loose bricks. Except through the town
itself, we had one walk, over one of these brick
paths to the Burmese cemetery. The whole subdivision
supported one pony. He lived in ease and
affluence, as you could not ride for half a mile
without coming upon an impassable stream. We
were the only European inhabitants. Two other
people spoke English, a Jew shopkeeper named
Cohen, whom Burmans, not holding him in high
respect, preferred to call Maung Hein,<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and an
Arakanese schoolmaster, with whom I maintained
an intermittent acquaintance to the end of my
service. Our nearest English neighbours were the
subdivisional officer of Yandoon and his wife, who
on one red-letter day paid us a flying visit. Our
medical attendant was an Indian hospital assistant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
or as now he would be called more appropriately,
Sub-assistant surgeon, a very capable, good man.
The civil surgeon lived at Maubin, the district headquarters,
a day’s journey off. To young civilians of
the present time, this would seem an impossible
place for a man with a wife and child. We enjoyed
life and were happy. The experience was of use to
me, years afterwards, as secretary, when young
officers complained of their posting by the Chief
Commissioner to remote and unpopular stations.
Even the young wife could not be played with
effect. But I believe I got myself disliked.</p>

<p>My official colleague was the subdivisional police
officer, Maung Shwe O, Inspector, afterwards
Assistant Superintendent. He was a very smart,
good-looking man, whose subsequent career was
distinguished. I maintained friendly relations with
him as long as I stayed in Burma. The clerks in
my office were Burmans, who spoke and wrote only
Burmese. Very capable and efficient were many
of these vernacular clerks, thoroughly versed in
office routine and management, and well educated
in their own language. My head clerk, Maung
Shwe Tha, was a man of presence and dignity,
with, it was said, a trace of French blood in his
veins. The Circle Thugyi still, I hope, survives
in honoured retirement. His son became one of
the most useful members of the Provincial Service.</p>

<p>The subdivision was of very large extent. Comprising
the townships of Pantanaw and Shwelaung,
it stretched past Kyunpyathat to the sea. At
Shwelaung there was a Myo-ôk, but at Pantanaw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
I was my own township officer. I had to try all
civil and criminal cases, to copy English correspondence,
and to do the revenue and executive
work of the township. Though during my year
at Pantanaw I had only second class powers
as a magistrate, still, without a Myo-ôk at headquarters,
and with all these various duties, it might
be supposed that I was grossly overworked. On
the contrary, I had an easier time there than ever
after fell to my lot. Still young and zealous, I
believe I did all there was to be done. But I found
time to be on tour about half of every month, while
in the cold weather I spent more than a solid month
in the jungle, walking over rice-fields, inspecting,
measuring, and computing the out-turn of every
holding in respect of which remission of revenue was
claimed. As there had been a somewhat widespread
failure of the rice crop, this was a task of some
magnitude. The development of the country and
the growth of work are impressed on me by nothing
so much as by a comparison between the Pantanaw
subdivision in 1879-80 and the same area in the
present day. Then, with the help of one not very
efficient Burmese Myo-ôk, I did all the work of the
subdivision with ease. Now that area is a large
part of the Ma-u-bin and Myaung-my̆a districts.
It occupies half the time of a Deputy Commissioner
and District Judge, and half the time of one or two
subdivisional officers, who break down in succession
from overwork, four or five township officers, and
several judicial and additional Myo-ôks. The
Shwelaung Township is now the Wakèma Sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>division,
one of the most laborious charges in the
Province. A very small, obscure, and swampy
village was Mawlamyainggyun, now the headquarters
of a township, and one of the most flourishing
towns in the Delta. I have always cherished
the belief that I was the first European official to
discover it.</p>

<p>In those days and in that part of the country
there was a remarkable absence of serious crime.
During my year at Pantanaw one murder was
committed and one dacoity was reported. Of the
dacoity I made a full meal. The report reached
me when on tour in the middle of the rains. Off
I went in a small open dugout to make an
investigation on the spot. Arriving, drenched to
the bones, with no kit, I held the inquiry, clad
in a bath towel, reclining in the balcony of a
Burmese hut, partly sheltered by a mat-wall. I
fared sumptuously on boiled eggs, rice, and jaggery
(palm sugar), fare, which I commend, as, if not
noble, yet enough. A mat on a plank floor was
a sufficient sleeping-place. I never found any difficulty
in sleeping on boards. The really hard bed
is the bosom of mother earth with too scanty an
allowance of straw. The report of the dacoity was
false.</p>

<p>At Pantanaw I learned to talk Burmese with
fluency, if not with accuracy, and to read it with
ease. I had to talk it or be silent half my days.
And all office work had to be done in the vernacular.
But too early and too long a stay in the Secretariat
and constitutional indolence prevented me from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
acquiring a profound or scholarly knowledge of the
language. Up to a certain point Burmese does not
seem to me abnormally difficult. The written
character, though at first sight it looks impossible,
is much easier than, for example, Urdu script.
But the attainment of real proficiency is a laborious
task. The want of good literature is a discouragement
at the outset. For, as a literary medium,
Burmese is singularly defective. According to one
of the best authorities, the high-water mark of
Burmese prose is reached in the State papers of the
Hlut-daw.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> As if one should seek for models of
prose in Blue-Books. A wealth of idioms, a chaotic
grammar,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> a variety of delicate accents, combine to
bewilder the student. Notwithstanding these drawbacks,
most of our officers have a good knowledge of
the spoken and written language, and some are
finished scholars. One thing all can do: all can
read petitions and other vernacular papers, and are
less in the hands of clerks than officers are understood
to be in other Provinces.</p>

<p>Here, too, I had opportunities of learning in
practice something about two of the main sources of
revenue, land and fisheries. Though the Land and
Revenue Act, recently brought into operation, is
not the most lucid of statutes, the land-revenue
system is free from complexity. Its chief merits
were sweetness and simplicity,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> as an ingenious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
printer tried to make the Burma Government plead
for its transliteration scheme. The State was the
landlord. It was, then, an article of faith that there
were no tenants in Burma, that every man cultivated
his own moderate holding. Though not literally,
this was for a long time approximately true.
In the Delta land was to be had in abundance, and
Burmans and Karens for the most part cultivated
their own farms. A constant and sufficient rainfall
and a fertile soil combined to yield a rich harvest.
Regular settlements were not begun till a year or
two later. Meanwhile the rates of land revenue
were absurdly low. Each holding was supposed to
be measured yearly by the Circle Thugyi, who had
no training in surveying. The Thugyi gathered in
the revenue of his Circle and received a liberal commission
on the collections. If crops failed or were
destroyed by drought, floods, or rats, generous
remissions of revenue were granted after inspection
by the subdivisional or township officer, or, where
large sums were involved, by the Deputy Commissioner
himself. When I hear urged against the
proposed nationalization of land the consideration
that the State would be an austere landlord,
requiring its dues each year without pity or indulgence,
I cannot help remembering that it was far
otherwise in Burma. It may be, however, that in
other countries the system would not be worked by
a Service whose members from their youth up are
trained to sympathize with the people, to regard as
their title to respect the name of the cherisher of
the poor. Besides land revenue, the only tax paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
by the cultivator was capitation tax. This was
paid by all sorts and conditions of men, except the
aged and infirm, at the rate of Rs. 5 for a married
man, and Rs. 2/8 for a bachelor. It was a crude
and unscientific tax, falling equally on rich and
poor. But it was a light burden, and crushed no
one. The standard of living among Burmans and
Karens in the Delta was moderately high. Luxuries
were few, but comforts were universal. Walking
over miles of rice-fields in familiar talk with Thugyis
and farmers, I became acquainted with the conditions
of the cultivators, and I laid the foundation of
lasting esteem and affection for the people.</p>

<p>My subdivision included many of the great
fisheries of the Delta. All the streams and creeks
were divided into fisheries, which were sold by
auction once a year. The Court House would be
filled with bidders, all fishermen, and the bidding
was often reckless. The large fisheries sold for
substantial sums, the total annual revenue being
about five lakhs of rupees. Inspection of fisheries
and examination of the methods of working were
among the subdivisional officer’s duties. Fishermen
destroy living creatures, and by good Buddhists are
held to be children of perdition. But they enjoy
life, regardless of the doom in store. A visit to one
of the great fishing villages was an agreeable incident,
pleasantly varying the monotony of official
routine. The whole village turned out in boats to
welcome us. Boats paddled by girls in bright
attire, carrying troupes of dancers gracefully posturing,
crowded the stream in picturesque profusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Races between canoes filled with crowds of shouting
paddlers went on throughout the day. At night
would be presented a pwè, or many pwès. Pwè is
one of the hardest worked of Burmese words, and
represents perhaps the most characteristic feature of
the country. In its best-known sense it means an
entertainment, usually dramatic, or of the nature of
a ballet. But a race also is a pwè, and so, singularly
enough, is an examination or a Durbar. The legitimate
drama is a puppet-show, the dolls being
cleverly worked by strings from behind the stage,
and the dialogue hoarsely recited by the manipulator
with hardly an attempt at ventriloquial effect. Less
highly esteemed by Burmese connoisseurs is a drama
played by real actors and actresses. The stock
characters are the prince, the princess, and the
clown. The princess, unabashed, arranges her hair,
makes up her cheeks and eyebrows, and even
manages to change her dress in view of the assembly.
The clown, by boisterous and often indecorous jest,
raises peals of merriment. The ballet pwè is a set
of posture dances, performed either by one, two, or
three girls, or by groups, generally of girls, sometimes
of young boys. Dancing is accompanied by
choric songs, often topically composed for the occasion.
If distinguished visitors are present, the
choral song is written to honour and welcome them.
The orchestra consists of drums, gongs, cymbals,
and other barbarous instruments placed in a circle
round the agile executant. In bygone days no
charge was made for admission. That was an
essential condition. Now I hear with horror of so-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>called
pwès played in enclosures where money is
taken at the door. A pwè lasted for hours. Almost
invariably it was performed in the open air, under
the moonlit sky, the spectators, men, women, children,
and babies, sitting on mats, smoking cheroots,
enthralled from dusk to dawn. For my part I liked
best the ballet, danced by groups of young girls,
daughters of the town or village, and after that
the drama played by human actors and actresses.
But I must admit that in a puppet-show the comic
white horse gaily prancing over the boards was
a joy which never failed. During my year at
Pantanaw I was a welcome guest at many pwès,
none of which I attended with greater pleasure
than a ballet danced by the girls of a large fishing
village.</p>

<p>All our travelling was by water. There was not
a steam-launch in the Delta. Even the Deputy
Commissioner did all his journeys in a rice-boat.
Such a luxury as a houseboat had not been designed
even in a vision. An officer going on tour hired a
fairly large boat with three or four rowers, and with
a helmsman (pènin) perched aloft in the stern.
Often one had the same boat and crew for successive
journeys. My pet pènin was a man of authority
(awza) and presence, traditionally reputed to be an
ex-dacoit. I hope he did not relapse in the troubles
which came a few years later. The forepart of the
boat was for the crew and servants. The after-deck,
covered by an arched roof of bamboo, formed a
chamber sufficiently roomy wherein was space to sit
or lie but not to stand upright. Privacy was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
secured by arrangements of kalagas (curtains). In
such a boat I travelled for a week, a fortnight, a
month at a time, halting at infrequent villages,
interviewing headmen and Thugyis, trying cases,
and doing revenue and executive work. As a rule
I travelled alone, always unarmed and without a
guard. No precautions were needed in that time of
profound peace, when we felt, and were, secure from
danger. Propelled by long oars, the boat moved
generally with the tide. But I have known
Burmans row with, and against, the tide for hours
at a stretch, a fact which may surprise people taught
to regard the Burman as an idle fellow. He is
neither idle nor lazy. When occasion demands, he
will work as hard as anyone. The farmer and fisherman
each has seasons when he must rise up early
and late take his rest. What the Burman does not
care to do is to make toil a pleasure; to work merely
for the sake of doing something or for the purpose
of amassing wealth beyond his needs. With a
fertile country, with no pressure of population on
subsistence, with few wants, why should he strive
or cry? For him progress and the strenuous life in
themselves have no attraction. We are trying to
teach him our ideals, to show him how far superior
is our civilization. When we shall have succeeded,
we shall have spoilt the pleasantest country and the
most delightful people in the world.</p>

<p>But let us resume our tour. By day or night, as
the tide serves, our boat moves on the bosom of the
wide river or threads the windings of narrow creeks.
In the rains I have been rowed against a storm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
wind, in a shroud of thick darkness. Again, I have
skirted miles of forest-clad banks, each bush alive
with myriads of fireflies, an amazing and memorable
sight. When villages were scarce, a halt would
be called and breakfast taken under the shade of a
mighty tree on the grassy margin of the stream. If
we stayed at a village for a day or two, our temporary
home was a zayat, one of the many rest-houses
built by pious hands for the comfort of wayfarers.
Every village had on its outskirts at least
one zayat, where the traveller could rest as long as
he pleased. With the help of a few kalagas and
mats lent by the villagers, a zayat could be made
quite comfortable. It was somewhat startling to
have a snake drop from the thatched roof on to
one’s plate at chota haziri.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> But such an unpleasing
incident was rare. Twice in the dry season I ventured
to take my young family on tour, and each
time we were swamped by cataracts of abnormal
rain. Once we were putting up in a roomy zayat,
when, soon after dark, a hurricane of wind arose,
and a deluge of rain began to fall. The kalagas
were blown in, and the baby almost blown out of
his cot. We were rescued by the headman, who
came with a train of lantern-bearers, and hospitably
bore us off to his house. The rest of the night we
spent under the family mosquito-net, the family
finding quarters elsewhere. The mosquito-net was
of stout opaque cloth, and covered the space of a
fair-sized room. My wife went no more on tour in
the Delta.</p>

<p>A pleasant interlude was an occasional visit to
Father Bertrand at his mission-station in a remote
corner of the subdivision. It is a common pose for
the man of the world to profess to regard missionaries
with suspicion, if not dislike, and to hold native
Christians in abhorrence. My experience has led
me far from these conclusions. The longer I lived
in the Province, the better I came to like, the more
to respect, missionaries, and the more esteem I felt
for Burmese and Karen Christians. The principal
missionary bodies in Burma are Anglicans, Roman
Catholics, and American Baptists. Among all these
I have found valued friends. One of the most venerable
personalities of my early years was the saintly
Bishop Bigandet, whose name will always be held
in reverence. Apart from the religious aspect, the
educational and civilizing value of mission-work
cannot be overrated. Some of the best schools and
one of the only two colleges are maintained by
missions. Though Burmans generally adhere to
their own creed, those who have become Christians
are for the most part men of good standing. I do
not think there are many bread-and-butter converts
among them. In an Upper Burman village I found
a Christian headman, who told me that his progenitors
had been of the same faith. A mission, it
was said, had been established there in the reign of
Queen Elizabeth, and the altar-fire had been kept
alive for three centuries. It seemed a creditable
record. But the most abundant harvest of mission-work
is yielded by Karens. The heathen Karen,
the missionaries call him, is an uncouth, savage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
person. The Christian Karen, though lacking the
grace and charm of the Burman, is a law-abiding
citizen, with many sterling virtues. Even by
Burmese officers it is recognized that there is very
little crime among Christian Karens. For this
backward race missionaries of all denominations
have done a vast amount of educating and civilizing
work. Without wishing to make any invidious
distinction, I know nothing more praiseworthy than
the devotion of Catholic missionaries, who live ascetic
lives in solitary places, sacrificing the world to their
vocation, subsisting on nothing a month, and giving
alms out of that wage. While on this subject, I
may mention the admirable work done among lepers
by Catholic missions in Mandalay and Rangoon.
At each of these places is an asylum for these
hapless outcasts, where all the nursing and attendance
are done by nuns and sisters. The devotion
of these gentle ladies is beyond all words of reverence.
Another excellent Catholic foundation is the Home
of the Little Sisters of the Poor in Rangoon. Here
aged and helpless men and women, without distinction
of race or creed, are received and kept in
comfort. It is pleasant to record that the Home
has been warmly and liberally supported by a
Burmese Buddhist, my worthy friend the Honourable
Maung Htoon Myat.</p>

<p>The memory of Father Bertrand has led me far
from Pantanaw. Our first year in a subdivision was
full of novelty and variety, not of an exciting kind,
and perhaps not of interest except to ourselves.
Though I learned something of the people, my stay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
was too short. I have no claim to intimate knowledge
of the Delta, such as that of my successor,
Mr. de la Courneuve, or my lamented friend Colonel
F. D. Maxwell,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> who knew every creek and channel,
and, apparently, every man, woman, and child, and
who was the leading authority on all questions
relating to fisheries. While at Pantanaw I made
the acquaintance of the remarkable man who planned
and executed the Irrawaddy Embankments, the late
Mr. Robert Gordon. The mere financial value
of this colossal undertaking to the people and to
Government may be reckoned by millions of pounds.
The work has stood the test of time, and still
remains a monument of skill and foresight, and a
source of enormous revenue.</p>

<p>In 1880 I spent a year in the Secretariat. After
acting for a short time as Assistant Secretary, I was
retained as third man to prepare the Annual Administration
Report and see through the Press the
departmental Reports and Resolutions. My friend
Mr. Burgess was acting as Secretary, the Junior
Secretary was Mr. E. S. Symes,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> one of the most
brilliant men of his time. He became in succession
Secretary, Chief Secretary, and Commissioner.
When the highest prizes of the Service were within
his grasp, a career of great distinction was prematurely
ended in melancholy circumstances early in
the year 1901. <i>Sunt lacrimæ rerum.</i> Whatever of
Secretariat work I knew, I learned from Mr. Burgess
and Mr. Symes. The Chief Engineer and Public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Works Secretary was Colonel Colin Scott-Moncrieff.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
This year, Mr. Aitchison went to Council, and was
succeeded by Mr. C. E. Bernard.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> One of the last
civilians from Haileybury, a nephew of John and
Henry Lawrence, Mr. Bernard came to Burma with
a great reputation. After serving for a short time
under Sir John Lawrence in the Punjab, and later
with unprecedented distinction in the Central
Provinces under Sir Richard Temple and in Bengal
under Sir George Campbell, he became Secretary to
Sir Richard Temple’s Famine Commission, and then
Secretary to Government in the Home Department.
He was much trusted by Lord Ripon, with whose
political opinions he sympathized. To him, I believe,
is mainly due the wide extension of Municipal Administration
in India. This, perhaps, can hardly be
regarded as his title to fame.</p>

<p>In the period covered by my recollections Mr.
Bernard holds a foremost place, and will be often in
the story. He was one of those rare souls who are
the salt of the earth. Bearing, I believe, in appearance
some likeness to John, in character he was
akin to Henry Lawrence. Deeply and sincerely in
sympathy with the people, despising the gaud and
glitter which some regard as essential in dealing
with Orientals,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> hating the shadow of injustice or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
harshness, his sole desire was to do his duty to the
utmost of his strength. His kindly consideration
was no mark of weakness. On occasion he could be
stern and unbending. He exacted, as he yielded,
obedience. Combining with the finest moral and
intellectual qualities eminence in all manly pursuits,
he stands forth as an ideal figure among the men
who have built up the Indian Empire. No more
chivalrous, high-minded gentleman ever served the
Crown. As an administrator, his knowledge of
detail, his extraordinary memory, his power of rapid
work, were almost unparalleled. It is ungracious to
suggest even minor defects in one to whom I owe so
much and who inspired in those privileged to be
near him all reverence and affection. It may be
that impatience of delay and of any failure from the
best led him to do the work of his subordinates
and that sometimes his judgment erred. But what
nobility of soul, what zeal for righteousness, what
effacement of self, what courage and resolution,
what fervent, unaffected piety! Twenty years
later, when mourned by all good men, Sir Charles
Bernard had long gone to his rest, his widow was
again in Burma. On the eve of her departure,
entirely of their own initiative, representative
Burmans of Rangoon brought her an address and
a piece of Burmese silver-work as a token of respect
for her husband’s memory.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>No one but Mr. Pepys could make interesting the
record of daily journeys to the Secretariat and the
compilation of Blue-Books. Let it suffice to say
that we established a precedent by observing the
prescribed date for the issue of the Administration
Report, a gloomy volume which no one save the
compiler of Moral and Material Progress has ever
been known to read. Mr. Regan, the indefatigable
Superintendent of the Government Press, who never
once failed in any undertaking, or in the fulfilment
of a promise, risked his life in a sampan and hurled
the copies for India on to the mail-boat a few
minutes before she left her moorings at midnight.
The Report was not lightened by the statement that
“a little tasteful carving relieves the baldness of
some of our police officers.” That was not the fault
of the printer.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
SOME ASPECTS OF BURMESE LIFE AND CHARACTER</h2>

<p>One of the odd jobs which fell to my lot in my first
year was to consult the Elders of Bassein on the
opium question. They were unanimous in their
condemnation of opium in every shape. Some races
consume opium in moderation, as Englishmen drink
beer, without visible harm. Indians, Chinese, Shans,
Kachins, may be consumers of opium, and none the
worse in health or morals. The Burman is differently
constituted. Perhaps by temperament he
lacks restraint, doing nothing without overdoing it.
Whenever a Burman takes to opium, he drifts into
excess and becomes an outcast from decent society.
The feeling of the better classes is perfectly consistent
on this point. The term “bein-sa” (opium-eater)
is among the most opprobrious epithets that
can be applied to anyone. Among other races
people of decent standing use opium as a relaxation
without loss of caste. Among Burmans it is not so.
Throughout my service I knew only one man of
position who was reputed to be a bein-sa. Even
in his case the reputation may have been undeserved.
In Upper Burma, in the King’s time, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
use of opium by Burmans was strictly prohibited,
and I believe the prohibition was generally enforced.
Exceptions were made in the case of Chinese and
others. But the suggestion that when we occupied
Upper Burma we found a flourishing though illicit
opium traffic in full swing is quite unsupported by
facts. As a race, it may be said that Burmans are
singularly free from the opium vice. The more
difficult it is made for Burmans to procure this drug,
the better it will be for the country.</p>

<p>Similarly, but in a less marked degree, intoxicating
drinks are avoided by good Buddhists. I was many
years in Burma before I saw a drunken Burman.
I am afraid that the habit of drinking is on the
increase. The most popular liquor is what is vulgarly
called “toddy,” no relation to the concoction dear
to Britons. It is not a spirit, but a juice extracted
from the tari palm, and should rightly be called
tan-ye, or tari. Unfermented, freshly drawn from
the tree in the cool of the morning, it is a pleasant
and refreshing drink, if somewhat oversweet. It
ferments rapidly of its own accord. Fermented, it is
a heady liquor, stealing away men’s brains. In dry
tracts, where the tari palm abounds, the consumption
of tari is very common, though still, I think,
not among the better classes. The Burman has no
head, and succumbs at once to a comparatively small
quantity of liquor. In his cups he is a quarrelsome,
truculent savage, one of the most dangerous
of created beings. Hence, in districts where palm-groves
decorate the landscape, violent crimes,
murders, cuttings, stabbings, are lamentably fre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>quent.
It has been suggested that if all tari and
kindred palms were destroyed, the golden age would
come again. Besides tari, country-made spirits are
consumed in large quantities, and illicit distillation
is commonly practised, a lucrative trade which fine
or imprisonment fails to suppress. For European
liquors, except, perhaps, bottled beer, as yet little
taste has been acquired. I should like to say that
the habit of drinking is confined to labourers and
peasants; but it cannot be denied that many people
of position, who should set an example, indulge in
it. Yet, on the whole, to drink is the exception; to
abstain is the rule.</p>

<p>Let us turn to pleasanter topics. The amusements
of the people are many and various. In the village
street you will see men sitting over a chess-board
playing a game very much like the chess known in
Europe. The moves and rules are similar, though
the shape of the pieces and their names are different.
A bad habit prevails of finishing each move by
thumping the piece loudly on the board. Card
games are also in high favour, the most esteemed
being the game called “ko-mi,” literally, “catch the
nine.” Of course, cards are played for money. The
Burman is a born gambler, and indulges his propensity
on every available occasion. We have austerely
set our faces against gambling in every form, especially
gambling with cards, and interfere not a little
with this fascinating pastime. Perhaps, contrary to
the current opinion derived from tales of travellers
and legends from the hills, the real defect of the
Englishman in Burma is that he is too serious, too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
little inclined to make allowances for a joyous, light-hearted
people. Public gambling is sternly discountenanced.
For many years the Legislature has
been occupied in devising measures for its suppression,
meeting by fresh enactments the ingenious
efforts of the Courts to find means to rescue the
gambler from the meshes of the law, of the gambler
to sail as near to the wind as possible without
capsizing. To the impartial observer these alternate
struggles of the Legislature to make its prohibitions
effective, of the Courts to provide loopholes for the
gambler to escape, afford much healthy amusement.
I have taken a hand in the game on both sides in
progressive stages of a varied career. Let me not
be thought too flippant. If Burmans would be content
to have quiet little ko-mi parties of friends in
their own houses, I for one should be the last to
object. But it is a well-known fact that gambling
parties are not conducted on these principles.
Practically it may be said that in every gambling
party someone makes a profit apart from the chances
or skill of the game. This is the essential distinction
of a common gaming-house, and the practice
is properly discouraged. When it is added that
gaming parties constantly lead to brawls, affrays,
violent assaults, and indirectly to thefts and embezzlements,
perhaps the attitude of the earnest
official may be regarded with sympathy. Pitch-and-toss
and other forms of gambling in public places
are prohibited, as in most civilized countries. Lotteries
are exceedingly popular; they are for the
most part promoted by the intelligent Chinaman, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
the detriment of the guileless Burman. A pleasing
form is that known as the “thirty-six animal”
lottery. The punter stakes on any of the animals
on the board; the winning animal, having been
previously secretly determined, is disclosed when
the stakes have been made. There is room here for
deception. King Thebaw is supposed to have ruined
half Mandalay by State lotteries established for the
purpose of raising revenue. No one will be surprised
to hear that lotteries on races, to which the authorities
are discreetly blind, are warmly supported by
Burmans of all classes; they are of a mild description,
tickets are cheap, and really hurt no one, like
the capitation tax. It is almost superfluous to
record that cock-fighting is a favourite pastime;
this, too, is against the law, but it is hardly on this
account less popular. I have heard of, but never

</div>

<p>An innocent game in which so far no one has
found the taint of sin is Burmese football (chin
lôn). It is played in the village street or any open
space, with a light, open-worked bamboo ball, by
any number of players. Some Burmans attain great
proficiency, kicking the ball with toe or heel, catching
it on their shoulders, making it leap unexpectedly
by mere exertion of the muscles. Real football is,
of course, an exotic, but has attained great popularity.
It is seldom that the introducer of a national
game can be identified, but in this case due credit
can be given to the right person. British football
was introduced into Burma some forty years ago by
Sir George Scott. When his statue adorns Fytche<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Square, among other trophies a football must be
carved at his feet. The game is played with zeal
and enthusiasm by countless Burman boys and young
men. To see Burmans kicking a football with naked
feet is a lesson in the hardness of the human sole.
Football matches attract great crowds of Burmans
in Rangoon and elsewhere. Mercifully the adoption
of the Association form of the game has been ordained.
To think of hot-headed Burmans engaged
in the rough-and-tumble of Rugby excites lurid
imaginings. As it is; the referee has an arduous
and anxious time. For the most part, however,
good-humour and a sporting spirit prevail.</p>

<p>Pony-races, races of trotting bullocks drawing
light carts, elephant-races, boat-races, are among
the most popular sports. These also, here as elsewhere,
give opportunities for gambling; but, apart
from this, great interest is taken in them. In one
of my subdivisions on one day of every week a local
pony race-meeting was held, attended by the whole
population of the small headquarter town, and often
graced by the presence of the leading officials. In
those parts of the country which are comparatively
or absolutely dry Burmans are good riders, accustomed
to ponies from their childhood. Their saddle
is horribly uncomfortable to a European, their
stirrups short, their knees near their noses. The
favourite pace is a smooth amble, untiring, it is
thought, both to rider and to steed. I have seen a
Burman, to avoid a soft place, ride a pony for some
yards along the parapet of a bridge with a good
drop below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>As might be expected in a country where the
waterways are many, Burmans are an amphibious
race, good swimmers, at home in the water, and
expert in the management of boats with oars and
sails. Wherever there is a stream, the whole population
bathes either at dawn or dusk. Men, women,
and children swim about together, and perfect
decorum is observed. Of course, boat-races are a
popular amusement. Long shallow canoes, paddled
by twenty or thirty men, all shouting a boastful
song, contend in these races. At the goal is a wand
suspended through a hollow bamboo. The man in
the bow of the leading boat carries off the wand.
There is thus never any dispute as to the winner.
The pace is pretty good, but not nearly so fast as
that of a good English four or eight.</p>

<p>As strict Buddhists, Burmans are supposed to
abstain from animal food, or, at least, from taking
life for the purpose of providing food. For fishermen,
who must break this precept daily, special
uncomfortable hells are reserved. Hunting and
shooting are practised at grave risk of future
disaster, and usually by the younger men who think
they have time to make up for these derelictions, or
are giddily thoughtless of the hereafter. A pious
friend of mine in Upper Burma used to be much
scandalized at the levity of his aged father, who
persisted in coursing hares when he ought to have
been making his soul. But as regards the consumption
of flesh of birds, beasts, and fish, there seems to
be no practical restraint among any class. So long
as you are not instrumental in causing death, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
may safely eat the flesh. Beef and poultry are
freely eaten when available. Often stolen cattle
are slaughtered and eaten. The flesh of no creature
which has died a natural death, except perhaps
dogs and tigers, is despised. Things which to our
taste have weird scent and flavour are highly appreciated.
The most popular article of food is ngapi, a
composition of fish suffered to decompose and prepared
in many ways, all equally malodorous in
result. This is universally used as seasoning of rice
at all meals. Then there is a dreadful fruit which
grows in the south, called a “durian,” a large
green fruit, bigger than an average cocoanut, with
a thick rind, containing big seeds embedded in a
sort of custard. It emits a disgusting odour, which
cannot be described in polite language. Of this
fruit Burmans are inordinately fond. In the King’s
time, every year as the season came round, His
Majesty used to charter a steamer solely to bring up
a cargo of durians. When, in later years, I told
the Ministers that we were about to build a railway
to Mandalay, the Prime Minister’s first remark was:
“Excellent; then we shall be able to get our
durians fresh.” To my mind the taste is worse than
the smell. Yet many Europeans regard this fruit
as a delicacy, and eat it freely, even greedily. My
theory is that the taste was painfully acquired by
officers stationed in remote places where durians
grow, and where there is nothing to do. By these
pioneers others were persuaded to essay the high
adventure. Of a habit so difficult of acquisition
and so morbid, the devotees are naturally a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
proud. One might suppose that the nostrils of
people who love ngapi and durians were proof
against any smell. On the contrary, Burmans are
very sensitive to the smell of oil burnt in cooking,
which they regard as <i>odor nervis inimicus</i>, particularly
hurtful to the sick, but grievous to anyone.
The third characteristic article of diet in Burma is
let-pet (pickled tea). So far as I know, this is
the ordinary tea of commerce, grown almost entirely
in the Northern Shan State of Taungbaing. It is
not used to make an infusion; the leaf is prepared
for use as a condiment. The trade and cultivation
are entirely in the hands of Shans and Palaungs.
Let-pet was brought down from the hills packed in
long baskets borne on bullocks, now more commonly
by train. It was formerly an article monopolized
by the King. I have not heard of any European
professing to like the taste of let-pet.</p>

<p>The Burman is first of all an agriculturist. He is
only a moderately good carpenter, though he can
put the bamboo to many uses. As a boat-builder
he excels, fashioning large boats on lines of grace
and beauty. Also he can, of course, make his
own flimsy house of mat and thatch, or a more
substantial dwelling of teak or jungle-wood. But
the few manual industries in which Burmans really
shine are those which have an artistic basis. Where
the secret of a glaze is known, as at Bassein in the
delta, and at Kyaukmyaung, the port of Shwebo,
pottery is practised as an hereditary art, and many
gracious shapes and designs are fashioned out of
ductile clay. Silk is grown by an obscure race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
called Yabeins. But it is as dangerous to cultivate
the silkworm as to be a fisherman. More often,
therefore, imported silk is used on Burmese looms,
where cloths of lovely mingled colours and delicious
wavy patterns are still produced. Alas! this charming
domestic industry is on the wane, and both silks
and cottons are now as a rule imported from Europe.
The fine natural taste of the people is deteriorating.
One of the saddest signs of this degeneracy is the
substitution of the ugly gingham or silk umbrella
for the darling, bright-coloured little tis,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> which
used to preserve the complexions of Burmese maids.
This cruel sacrifice to economy and utility has
almost succeeded in spoiling the incomparable
dazzling glory of mingled colour which used to
characterize a Burmese crowd. On the occasion of
a royal visit to Mandalay, when boat-races were
being held on the Moat amid the most picturesque
surroundings, the delightful effect of rows upon
rows of gaily dressed Burmans lining the farther
edge was marred by a forest of imported umbrellas
reared hideous to the sky. However, word was
sent along the line that it was disrespectful to raise
an umbrella in the presence of royalty. And as if
at the touch of an enchanter’s wand, the horrible
excrescences disappeared and light and beauty
reigned once more.</p>

<p>An extraordinarily effective art is the lacquer-work
of Pagan. Bowls of exquisite shape, boxes
for sacred books or for carrying the necessary betel,
offer choice specimens of the artist’s skill. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
designs in rich colouring on these lovely works are
full of vigour and originality. Lacquering is a
laborious art. A really fine box or bowl takes
months to complete. The most elaborate work is
based on a foundation of horsehair, the finished product
so flexible and supple that a bowl can be bent
till the opposite sides meet without the fabric
cracking. I confess that, as regards my own
treasured specimens, I am content to know that
this can be done without putting them to the test.
Even at Pagan the hateful modern spirit has begun
to shed baleful influence. Mingled with bowls and
boxes, consecrated by use and wont, may be seen
cigar cases of Western shapes and other signs of
decadence.</p>

<p>Burmese silver-work and wood-carving are world-renowned.
These fine arts are still flourishing.
Besides fashioning portable articles, such as figures
of men and elephants, or ornamented boxes, wood-carvers
show their skill and taste in elaborate designs
on monasteries and other public buildings. Some
of the carving on monasteries in Mandalay, the
Queen’s Monastery in A Road, and others of earlier
date, is of the highest æsthetic merit. The specimens
of wood-carving in the Palace have never appealed
to me so intensely. In the presentation of figures
the execution is bold and dignified. Wood-carving
seems to me to have preserved its native simplicity,
to have been less affected than other arts by devastating
Western contact. Silver-workers still produce
fabrics of grace and beauty in the best indigenous
fashion; but too often degenerate teapots and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
decadent toilet-sets give evidence of debasing utilitarian
propaganda. I grieve to hear that electric
light has been installed on the Great Pagoda in
Rangoon as well as in the temple of the Yakaing
Paya.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Much have we done for Burma. But it is
sad to think that we have sullied and smirched the
tender bloom of Burmese art and artistic ideals.</p>

<p>Of the national character, indications will be
found scattered over these pages. It is a mass of
apparent inconsistencies. Kindness and compassion
are noticeable virtues. Children are treated
with indulgence, not always according to discretion.
You will see a constable come off a long spell of
sentry duty, and straightway walk about with a
child perched on his shoulder. No orphan is left
desolate. No stranger asks in vain for food and
shelter. Yet these good people have a full mixture
of original sin. They produce dacoits who perpetrate
unspeakable barbarities on old men and women.
Sudden and quick in quarrel, the use of the knife is
lamentably common. Gay, careless, light-hearted,
with a strong if uncultured sense of humour, they
can be cruel and revengeful. The statistics of the
Courts reveal a mass of criminality as shocking as
it is surprising. Murders, dacoities, robberies,
violent assaults, are far too numerous. I can understand
the prevalence of crimes of passion and impulse;
but in a land flowing with milk and honey, a fair and
fertile land where there are work and food enough for
everyone, I cannot understand why there should be
any such sordid crimes as theft and embezzlement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>Two characteristics distinguish Burmans from
most other Eastern races. They have no caste, and
there is no seclusion of women. Socially, therefore,
we can meet on equal terms. A Burman does not
shrink from eating and drinking in our company, or
need to undergo elaborate and expensive purification
if by accident or design he is sullied by our contact.
If I go to visit a Burman, I am received by his wife
and daughters, and in turn when, often with the
ladies of his house, he comes to see me, he is welcome
to associate on friendly terms with my family. The
absence of caste does much to facilitate the task of
administration. Partly owing to the intelligence
and docility of the people, but mainly on account of
this lack of caste, we were able, for instance, to
carry out, with no serious trouble, measures for
suppressing plague. Our real difficulty, I may say
parenthetically, was to find the right measures
to take. In the end what some people call the
disgusting practice of inoculation seems to have been
found most beneficial. In some places people were
encouraged to be inoculated by making the occasion
a festival; pwès were held, small presents given to
children, prizes distributed by lotteries in which the
chances were free. In Sagaing last year, out of a
population of ten thousand, eight thousand were
inoculated. The local officers and their wives underwent
the operation, often more than once, by way of
inspiring confidence, as for the same purpose my
wife and I were vaccinated years before at Pantanaw.
Among those inoculated there were no cases of
plague. The ridiculous suggestion that inoculation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
tends to spread plague has been, we might almost
say, disproved by specific experiments in Burma
and, I doubt not, elsewhere.</p>

<p>To resume. Burmese women hold a position as
dignified and assured as in any country of the
world. Every Buddhist believes that women are
inferior to men, that a really good woman may have
the luck to be born a man in a future incarnation.
Every Burman knows that a woman is as good as a
man, and often better. It was in my experience
that occurred the pleasing incident elsewhere told
not quite correctly. A young woman came to me
for a reduction of her income-tax. She said she
earned her living by selling in the bazaar.</p>

<p>“What does your husband do?” I asked.</p>

<p>“He stays at home and minds the children.”</p>

<p>This was an exceptional case, but it illustrates the
relative position. Burmese women take an active
part in the business of the country. Most of the
retail trade is in their hands; sometimes they
manage more important commercial affairs. The
control of a stall in bazaar or market is regarded as
a very desirable occupation. Is it indiscreet to
suggest that opportunity for gossip is an attraction?
Often a wife takes great interest in her husband’s
official or private work. If one has business with a
police-sergeant or Thugyi, and finds him absent, one
does not seek a subordinate, but discusses and settles
the matter with the Sazin-gadaw or the Thugyi-gadaw.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
It is on record that, prisoners being
brought to a police-station in the absence of any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the force, the sergeant’s wife put them in the cage,
and, herself shouldering a da, did sentry-go till
relieved. After these instances it need hardly be
said that in her own household the Burmese woman
is supreme. Her position is equalled only by that
of a French mother.</p>

<p>Girls may not go to monasteries for instruction,
so elementary education is not universal among
women as among men. But many girls, especially
of the richer classes, learn to read and write. I
think more women are literate than among other
Eastern people. Practice in the bazaar, at any rate,
makes them ready at mental arithmetic. One day
I was holding an amateur examination of a monastic
school. The mothers sat round, admiring the
academic gymnastics of their infant prodigies.
Presently I set in Burmese form a variation of the
old theme of a herring and a half. All the boys
and all their teachers took slates and began to figure
laboriously. Almost before they had begun the
bazaar women in the circle laughed and gave the
answer. One pleasing characteristic of Burmese
ladies, rare among people of warm climates, may be
mentioned. Those who have not lived roughly, but
have been properly housed and tended, preserve a
youthful appearance in the most surprising manner
quite to mature age. Very rare among women of
all classes is the aged appearance of comparatively
young women.</p>

<p>An admirable trait is the remarkable absence of
serious crime among women. It is quite rare to find
a woman in prison, and I remember no instance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the execution of a woman. While gaols in Burma
provide quarters for 15,000 men, they can accommodate
only 354 women. These seem to me very
remarkable figures. There is no crowding on the
women’s side of the gaol. Indeed, if imprisonment
of women were abolished in Burma, no harm would
be done. I suppose Burmese women produce fewer
criminals than any other civilized race. Not that
they are all angels; they are apt to be hasty and to
offend with their tongues. Sometimes the bazaar is
the scene of actual conflict between angry fair ones.
But on the whole Burmese women are strikingly
innocent and well-behaved. Good mothers and
honest wives, light-hearted and sociable, they are
justly held in high esteem.</p>

<p>Burmese girls enjoy much freedom. You may see
them laughing and talking at the village well, sitting
at the domestic loom, walking in the roads, engaged
on household duties. Infant marriage is unknown;
no Burmese girl marries except to please herself.
Like other Orientals, girls come early to maturity,
and marriages at fourteen or fifteen are not uncommon;
but as often as not a Burmese maiden
does not marry till she is eighteen or nineteen, or
even older. She must not wait too long, or she will
be laughed at as an old maid.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The relations between
the sexes are much the same as in Western
countries. Boys and girls and men and women fall
in and out of love and break one another’s hearts
after the best traditions of romance. Jealousy is a
prevalent vice, and many die for love.</p>

<p>Buddhism recognizes and allows polygamy, and
it is incorrect to say that plurality of wives is
uncommon. Several different kinds of wives are
described in the Law of Manu, which contains even
an account of the popular modern character, the
wife like a mother. But many, probably most,
men live happily with one wife all their lives. In
any case, the first or principal wife has a distinct
and honoured place in the household. No ceremony
of marriage is necessary or, among the mass of the
people, usual. The high Buddhist theory, how
different from the practice of this joyous people,
regards life as a mistake, this world as a vale of
tears, transitory existence as the supreme evil, and
bids us all aim at the goal of eternal rest. Therefore
no Burmese monk would bless a marriage; he is
more at home at a funeral. Mutual consent is the
sole essential of a marriage. Similarly, divorce is
easy. No Court need intervene. Ordinarily, separation
is effected by arrangement between the parties,
sometimes in the presence of the village elders.
Although the Courts have not, perhaps, said the
last word on the law of the subject, it is commonly
accepted that, even without fault on either side,
one party to the marriage can insist on divorce
against the wish of the other party to the contract.
In this respect men and women are on equal terms.
The safeguard against capricious divorce is supplied
by strict rules for the division of property at the
dissolution of a marriage. In the case mentioned
above, the one who insists on separation must
abandon all property to the reluctant partner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Though so easy, divorce is far less common than
might be expected. Most married people live together
till death parts them. It is not unusual for
divorced people to come together again. An appreciable
proportion of the crimes of violence is due to
the refusal of a woman to rejoin her divorced husband.
I do not suggest that the Burmese law and
practice of divorce would be suitable in communities
of a more complex type. The comparatively even
distribution of wealth, the fertility of the soil and
the scantiness of the population, the absence alike
of great fortunes and of abject, pinching poverty,
the kindly disposition of the race, probably combine
with more obscure elements to render somewhat
primitive conditions possible. It is quite certain
that in the stage which Burmese civilization has
reached the simple marriage law works well and
produces no obviously ill-effects. It need hardly
be said that there is no bar to the marriage of
widows.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
ON THE FRONTIER</h2>

<p>Early in 1881 I went for a very short term to
Myaung-my̆a, in the Delta. The subdivisional
officer having suddenly broken down, I was sent
to superintend the taking of the Census. At
Myaung-my̆a, newly constituted the headquarters
of a subdivision, there was no house. I lived in a
zayat near the Court. Myaung-my̆a is now the
chief town of an important district, with a Deputy
Commissioner as well as a Divisional and District
Judge. Having finished the Census, I went to
Bassein, riding most of the way over bare rice-fields.
Everywhere I was received with the generous
hospitality characteristic of the Burmese people, and
I made many pleasant acquaintances among Thugyis
and villagers. One village headman lives in my
memory, a stalwart Karen who in his youth had
been the champion boxer at the Court of Mandalay.
He said so, and he ought to know. Probably his
position was not one of high eminence; Burmese
and Karen boxing is a mild game. The challenger
leaps into the ring; slapping his chest, he dances
round, bidding all come on. It is one of the rules of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the game that the players should be equally matched
in size and weight. With much difficulty a competitor
is found to fulfil the requirements and accept
the challenge. At last preliminaries are arranged,
and the boxers face each other in the ring. They
may kick, and they may slap with open hand, but
not with closed fist. As soon as a drop of blood is
drawn from the slightest scratch, the fight is at an
end. Gloves are not worn. This may sound barbarous,
and should be exciting; as a matter of fact,
it is very harmless and extremely dull. In my
experience, Karens are better at the game than
Burmans.</p>

<p>For the rest of my time as subdivisional officer,
I stayed at Bassein as the guest of Colonel William
Munro, the Deputy Commissioner, an officer of the
old school who had spent his life in Burma. Colonel
Munro made use of the aptitude presumed to have
been acquired in the Secretariat during the past
year and set me to write all his annual reports on
the sole basis of the figures in the appended statements.</p>

<p>My next charge was the frontier subdivision of
Mye-dè in the Tha-yet-my̆o district. The headquarter
town was Allan-my̆o, called after Major
Allan who was Quartermaster-General when the
frontier was demarcated. Allan-my̆o lies on the
Irrawaddy, just over five miles north of Tha-yet-my̆o,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
the district headquarters. The distance had
to be more than five miles, or travelling allowance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
for the journey would have been inadmissible.
Above Allan-my̆o were the villages of Myedè and
Mobôn. Long ago were two young Princes, blind.
It was foretold that if they went down the Irrawaddy
they should recover their sight. So they set
out on a raft. Presently, at a place where they
landed, they perceived a glimmering of the sky and
exclaimed: “Mo-bôn; there is the sky above.” A
few miles farther on, landing again, they saw the
ground on which they stood, and cried: “Mye-dè;
there is the earth beneath.” Thus was the prophecy
fulfilled and the places received their names. Six
miles north of the flagstaff on the fort at Myedè,
then no longer a place of arms, was the starting-point
of the frontier-line laid down by Lord Dalhousie’s
personal direction.</p>

<p>The subdivision was a compact area of about a
thousand square miles. A comparatively barren
land, fringed by hills of no great height, intersected
by many watercourses, now beds of dry sand, anon
rushing torrents. These mountain-streams come
down with sudden violence. Often returning from
a walk or ride, one sat awaiting the subsidence of a
river bubbling over a sandy bed where an hour or so
before one had passed dry-shod. Sad stories were
told of travellers cut off in mid-stream by a rapid
flood and forced to spend the night on a diminishing
islet of sand. As a rule these chaungs<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> were not
too deep to ford on pony-back, though as often as
not the pony created a painful diversion by sitting
down unexpectedly and wallowing in the waves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
In these northern wilds were no teeming rice-fields,
no fat fisheries. The people were poor and unsophisticated,
raising scanty rice-crops with the aid
of primitive irrigation works, earning a precarious
livelihood by boiling cutch (catechu) or cultivating
taungya<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> on the hillsides. One valuable crop they
had, sessamum (hnan); but the farmer could not
reckon on a good hnan season every year. Scattered
among the hills were villages of tame Chins
who had drifted down from their own land in the
distant north-west of Upper Burma. Here were to
be seen women with faces tattoed in close blue lines,
according to legend a precaution against the too
demonstrative admiration of their Burmese neighbours.
The effect was singularly unbecoming, and
already the younger women were organizing successful
resistance. Chins were excellent settlers, careful
and frugal cultivators, their villages models of neatness
and cleanliness as compared with Burmese
villages similarly situate. Much as I love Burmans,
I cannot honestly commend the state of their
villages. Fenced in as a protection against dacoits,
the houses closely jammed together with no respect
for order; the paths, especially at the gateways,
trodden into pulpy masses of mud by the trampling
oxen; the ground-floor of each hut a pen where
cattle are installed each night; a Burmese village is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
an insanitary though often picturesque abode. Even
the odours seem to me less fragrant and pleasing
than to some more enthusiastic votaries. In the
simple agricultural conditions of this primitive community,
the revenue work was very light. The
only trouble arose from disputes about irrigation and
rights to water. Bench work in criminal matters
was not excessive, and most of the civil cases were
tried by the My̆o-ôk (township officer). There was
ample leisure for travelling. All the touring was
done on Burman ponies, strong and willing little
creatures, averaging about 12½ and never exceeding
13½ hands. At that time it was an article of faith
that horses, or even ponies of Waler or Arab or
country-bred classes, could not live in Burma. We
have learnt better in recent years. Most of the
riding was along jungle paths through <i>in</i>-tree forest
on sandy soil, quite good going even in the rains;
but there were craggy bits in the hills and quick-sands
in the streams. Touring in Burma has always
been less luxurious than camp-life in India. We
travelled at every season of the year, carrying no
tents, but finding abundant shelter in monasteries
and zayats, or in frequent police-stations. Everywhere
monks and villagers were hospitable and
friendly. Circle Thugyis flourished, men who held
office in succession to a long line of forefathers.
Save in one respect, the people did not seem to have
many criminal tendencies. It was natural to see
the stocks near the village gate; it would have been
surprising to see them occupied.</p>

<p>We marched with Sinbaungwè in Upper Burma.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
The border was marked by stone pillars at set
intervals and by an actual line cut in the turf,
which had to be inspected periodically and kept in
visible repair. Along the frontier at intervals of
four or five miles was a series of police posts.
Picture a quadrangular enclosure girt by a kya-hlan<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
of stout bamboos interwoven with a bristling
array of bamboo-spikes, quite an efficient protection
against a rush if the heavy wooden gate was closed.
Beside the gate stood a watch-tower. In the midst
was a station-house and office, with a barred wooden
cage for prisoners. Round this were grouped the
small but sufficient houses of the constables and
native officers. The posts were garrisoned entirely
by local Burmans armed with das<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and muskets.
The policeman of those days was a picturesque
person, in Burmese dress, of a pattern to some
extent dependent on the taste of the Superintendent.
A red-striped paso or lôngyi<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> marked the
servant of the Queen. He wore his hair long,
surmounted by a gaungbaung,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and was not expected
to pose as a Gurkha sepoy. With all his
many and pleasing virtues and vices, one quality his
warmest admirers have never claimed for the average
Burman, respect for discipline. You may drill
Burmans till they look as smart as soldiers of the
line, and you can teach them to shoot excellently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
But so far it has not been found possible successfully
to train them in habits of discipline and
method. It was, therefore, never a surprise, though
it excited clamorous if unreasonable wrath, when,
on reaching a police post a few hundred yards from
the frontier, one found the great gate ajar, the
watch-tower empty, and the sentry either absent on
his own more or less lawful occasions, or peacefully
sleeping with his musket by his side. This was
well enough in quiet times, but when the war came
the result was seen in the desertion of the frontier
posts, and their destruction by roving bands of
dacoits.</p>

<p>The frontier-line started from a pillar on the bank
of the Irrawaddy, on a spot visited by the great
Governor-General himself. Hard by, on each side
of the boundary, was a telegraph office. Though
the wires ran from Rangoon to the border, and from
the border to Mandalay, there was not sufficient
comity between the Governments to allow the line
to be linked. Every message to and from Upper
Burma had to be carried by hand across the intervening
space of a few yards and resignalled. Our
telegraph office was the place where the subdivisional
officer met the Wun<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> of Sinbaungwè for the discussion
of frontier affairs. With that official, who was
of about the same standing as myself, my relations
were somewhat stiff, civil but hardly cordial. It is
a mistake to suppose that the relations between
Europeans and Burmans are less intimate now than
in earlier days. Twenty years later, in similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
circumstances, I should certainly have asked the
Wun to breakfast or dinner. Then, our meetings
were rigidly formal and official. The Wun used to
annoy me by coming into the room wearing Burmese
shoes, a studiously discourteous act.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> I could think
of no better retort than to keep my hat on during
the interview. I dare say it was unworthy, but I
think it was human to feel a thrill of satisfaction
when, four or five years later, my old friend Maung
Lat came to me in my office in Mandalay crouching
on the ground in the Burmese attitude of respect.
Maung Lat was a handsome man, of the usual type
of Burmese district officials. After the annexation
he took service under our Government and became
a My̆o-ôk. He did good work, and <i>felix opportunitate
mortis</i>, died before he was found out. At our
meetings at Myedè, cattle-driving raids across the
frontier were among the most frequent subjects of
discussion. This was the darling sin of adventurous
spirits on each side of the border. In a country
where cattle are the most valuable of the farmer’s
possessions, cattle theft is one of the crimes which
most sorely vexes the magistrate’s righteous soul, and
is most rigorously punished. All possible steps were
taken to suppress it, and offenders were visited with
stripes and imprisonment. Yet one could not help
recognizing that to drive whole herds of oxen across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
the border, to evade police posts, to carry the spoil
by unfrequented paths through the heart of our
districts till it could be sold many miles away,
perhaps in a cattle-market under the eyes of
officials, was an attractive and exciting adventure.
On the whole, our men had the worst of the game.
If they were caught driving cattle from across the
frontier, they were punished as if they had committed
the offence in British territory, while cattle-thieves
from Upper Burma who got over the line
with their plunder were seldom brought to justice.
Hence many wrangles with Maung Lat. Once only
I really had the best of the encounter. I bluffed
him into handing back to me on the spot a man who
had been seized on our side and carried off to
Sinbaungwè. At the time the incident seemed to
me of international importance.</p>

<p>The man who had set his stamp on the subdivision
was my friend Mr. Burgess, who spent there
the first seven years of his service, greatly to the
benefit of himself and of the people. He made
roads, kept the peace, and impressed the countryside
by his zeal for justice and good order. Even in
those dark days, before the light of a Decentralization
Commissions had shone, needless transfers
seem to have been avoided. The township officer,
my old and valued friend and colleague, Maung Tet
Py̆o, held his charge for many years. He was an
official of the very oldest school, not very learned,
with only a working knowledge of codes, but
thoroughly acquainted with every inch of his township,
and with every man, woman, and child of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
people. He had, of course, no English. I doubt if he
was ever required to pass a departmental examination.
His handwriting was so bad that my
Burmese clerks often had to come to me to decipher
it. Maung Tet Py̆o was a man of courage and
energy, who somewhat shocked the straighter sect
of Buddhists by being an ardent sportsman. Burmans
told with admiration that he shot birds on the
wing. He filled the measure of his days, was
decorated, and many years after his retirement died
honoured and lamented. Curiously enough, though
so nearly illiterate, he will probably be remembered
as the compiler of a book on the “Customary Laws
of the Chins,” a treatise which attracted the attention
of Mr. Jardine,<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> the Judicial Commissioner, and
was translated under his direction. The manuscript
was beautifully written out by my clerk, Maung Po,
afterwards a My̆o-ôk, one of my many Burmese
friends, who, I suspect, was responsible for more
than the transcription.</p>

<p>At Tha-yet-my̆o, then a military station of some
importance, were half the 43rd Regiment, still on
this side of the frontier, the 44th Regiment, two
battalions of Madras Infantry, and guns. The fort,
north of the town, was duly garrisoned. At
Allan-my̆o we had a detachment of British infantry
in barracks on the hills east of the station. The
civil officers were the Assistant Superintendent of
Police, the late Mr. B. K. S. MacDermott, afterwards
in the Commission, best of comrades and good
fellows, and the Assistant Engineer, Mr. H. W.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
James, now Superintending Engineer. A small
Customs Office was maintained for the registration
of inland trade. The subdivisional officer was
Collector of Customs, without fee or reward. In
that capacity he had the use of the Customs boat,
a stout English gig, very convenient for crossing the
river, here about two miles wide. I have often seen,
by the way, an elephant swim across with just
enough of his head above water to seat the mahout.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
At Allan-my̆o there was a decent little house, close
to the river-bank. When the Irrawaddy rose, the
room on the ground-floor was generally flooded.
At the beginning of the rains this room used to be
invaded by swarms of tiny land-crabs, more pleasing
visitors than scorpions. Sometimes for a few days
the whole town was under water, and we went
about in boats.</p>

<p>Myedè, traversed by the Pegu Yoma, was
pleasanter, but less healthy, than the Delta. Here
I had an attack of malarial fever, of no great
severity, which left me subject to a recurrence for
the next fourteen years or so. After that it seemed
to be worn out. We had also in my time a dreadful
outbreak of cholera throughout the subdivision.
Deaths were reckoned by scores, and villages were
almost depopulated. Riding to visit the infected
parts, we expected to find the dead lying unburied
in streets and houses; happily the expectation was
not literally fulfilled.</p>

<p>Speaking from my personal experience, I regard
Burma as a healthy country as compared with other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
regions of the tropics. Much depends on the comfort
in which one lives. The very bad name which
Burma no doubt has acquired is due to a great
extent to the rapid succession of the three Burmese
Wars. After each of these wars, troops, military
and civil officers, and police suffered many hardships
and privations, bivouacking under the stars, and often
irregularly fed. In these conditions sickness ensued,
and much mortality and invaliding. For people
properly housed and assured of a square meal at the
right time, Burma is healthy enough. For those
who work all the year round in the jungles of Upper
Burma, it is rather sickly. On the whole, Lower
Burma, except Arakan and the tracts bordering on
the Yomas, is healthier than Upper Burma. Cholera
and plague are not peculiar to Burma, and are not
more deadly than in other parts of India.</p>

<p class="caption smcap">When the floods are out.</p>
</div>

<p>Of the wealth of insect-life much has been written.
Besides mosquitoes, ants, white, red, and black, flying
and merely creeping, abound in copious variety.
Once at least they stopped a ball at Government
House, flying in hosts, dropping their wings and
therewith their bodies, and reducing the floor to a
mucous mass. For me, at Allan-my̆o, others of their
species eviscerated all my books during my brief
absence. At the beginning of the rains strange
creeping, crawling, flying things, slimy things with
legs, appear in swarms. The centipede makes his
nest in your sponge; the scorpion lurks in your
boot. Snakes, too, are fairly numerous and of
many kinds, from the hamadryad who chases the
wayfarer, to the Russell’s viper who lies dormant
in his path, and when trodden on turns like any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
worm. Apart from these disadvantages, I have no
complaint to make of Burma as a country to live in.</p>

<p>While discussing these generalities, I may say a
few words about the climate. Naturally, in so large
an extent of country, this is subject to considerable
variations. The Delta is hot and steamy with an
abundant never-failing rainfall, and no cold weather
to speak of. Much of Upper Burma is an arid plain,
with frequent hills, hot and dry, but relieved by a
pleasant cold season. Even here we do not seem to
get the constant stifling heat, day and night, of which
we hear in the plains of Northern India. I suppose
some people find the heat trying. An old friend of
mine had the habit after dinner of calling his neighbour’s
attention to a picture on the wall, while he
surreptitiously emptied his finger-bowl down his
(own) neck. In Mandalay for some months of the
wet season (not so very wet) a tearing wind rages,
and is apt to shatter one’s nerves. In Lower Burma
the persistent rainfall is impressive. People who
have lived there hardly notice that it ever rains in
England. But it seldom pours both morning and
evening. Generally it is possible to get out for
exercise either at dawn or at close of day.</p>

<p>To return to my subdivision. By an arrangement
which seems anomalous, but which worked well
enough, for a substantial part of my sojourn in
Myedè I was also Cantonment Magistrate at
Tha-yet-my̆o. The Commanding Officer most kindly
supervised the establishment which dealt with
hedges and ditches. My duty was to try civil and
criminal cases, keep the accounts, and attend the
periodical meetings of the Cantonment Committee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
These were friendly gatherings where, unless the
secretary officiously intervened, many pleasant
stories whiled away the tedious hours. If I worked
very hard, my duties on an average occupied about
five or six hours a week, for which I drew an allowance
of Rs. 200 a month. I spoil no one’s market
by revealing the existence of this fat sinecure; the
stipend was reduced by an economical Commission
in 1887, and has since been abolished. My Deputy
Commissioners were Colonel Horatio Nelson Davies,
who had been Sir Arthur Phayre’s secretary, my
friend R. H. Pilcher, and Captain (now Colonel)
W. F. H. Grey, from all of whom I received much
kindness. Nor can I forbear to mention the hospitality
of Captain William Cooke,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> whose house
was always open to me, and with whom the friendship
begun in those distant days still flourishes.
The chaplain, the Rev. J. D. Briscoe, one of the
best of men, was also among my allies. He died,
most sincerely mourned, in the flower of his age, I
believe from the effects of asceticism practised from
no doctrinal motives, but for the sake of example to
the soldiers among whom he worked.</p>

<p>Some excitement was caused by the coming of a
Burmese embassy accredited to the Viceroy. Among
them was the Kyaukmyaung Atwin-Wun,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> son-in-law,
of the Taingda Mingyi, whom afterwards I knew
well at Mandalay. Mr. Pilcher, who was deputed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
accompany them to Simla, had met them all frequently
when Assistant Resident at the Burmese
Court. But though he was distinguished from his
fellows by a flowing beard, they declined to recognize
him, professing that in their eyes all kalas were
alike. Robert Pilcher had other attributes besides
his beard which might have commended him to
Burmese officials. His knowledge of their language
was scholarly and profound, while his sympathy with
the people was infinite. Nothing that concerned
them was alien from him. An instance may be given.
Once in after-years he was with a column on march.
Halting the column, he sat down by the wayside to
get some information from a Burman passer-by.
Presently the patient Commanding Officer asked
gently if the information had been extracted.
“I am so sorry,” was the reply; “I forgot all about
it. He was telling me such an interesting story
about his aunt.” The Mission was hospitably received
and entertained at Simla, but returned without
having effected any useful purpose. Which
reminds me of the Burman schoolboy who, asked to
translate <i>mortuus est re infectâ</i>, ventured to reply:
“He died of an infectious disease.”</p>

<p>But by far the most thrilling incident of my stay
at Allan-my̆o was the visit of Sir Frederick Roberts.
He came as Commander-in-Chief of the Madras
Army, the troops in Burma being in the Madras
command.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Attended by his staff, among whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
were General Godfrey Clerk,<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Captain Neville
Chamberlain,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and Captain G. Pretyman.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> His
Excellency came to inspect the frontier stations,
and marched from Allan-my̆o to Toungoo across the
Yôma,<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> which parts the Tha-yet-my̆o and Toungoo
districts. Fresh from the glories of Afghanistan
and the march to Kandahar, though then but midway
in his illustrious career, Sir Frederick Roberts
was a hero in all men’s eyes. It was my happy lot
to make arrangements for his march and to accompany
him through my subdivision. Thus as a young
man I had the privilege of experiencing the unrivalled
charm and personal attraction or this great
soldier. To the end of my days in the East I have
seen the eyes of old native officers light up at the
mention of Lord Roberts Sahib. Not Nelson himself
inspired more affection and enthusiasm in
officers and men who served and followed him.</p>

<p>At the close of this year, being sent to represent
the Tha-yet-my̆o District, I saw the first of many
Viceroys who visited Burma, Lord Ripon. I need
hardly say that I was too junior to be brought into
immediate contact with His Excellency or his staff.
Mr. Primrose<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> was private secretary, and Major<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
Evelyn Baring,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Finance Member, was of the Viceroy’s
party. The most obvious result of Major
Baring’s visit was the stoppage of most of our
remunerative jail industries. The order for discontinuance
was of general application throughout
India; Burma, still an unsophisticated place, under
a ruler who had learned to obey, was the only
Province which made a serious effort to carry the
order into effect. The usual festivities were held in
honour of the Viceroy’s visit, a ball, a levée, and a
garden-party. The most picturesque incident that
lingers in my mind is the posting of venerable
Burmese officers, in fur coats, clasping to their
breasts silver-mounted das, in the corridors of
Government House, as a-thet-daw-saung<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> to Their
Excellencies.</p>

<p>At Tha-yet-my̆o, for the first and last time, and
only for a few days, I held charge of a district as
acting Deputy Commissioner. For various reasons
there was a temporary lack of senior officers in the
district. For a short period I was not only Deputy
Commissioner, but also Cantonment Magistrate,
Superintendent of Police, and Superintendent of the
Jail. I did not succeed in drawing the pay of all
these offices.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
THE SECRETARIAT: THE LAST SUBDIVISION</h2>

<p>Early in 1883 the acting Chief Commissioner,
Mr. Crosthwaite,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> very considerately gave me the
option of coming to Rangoon as Junior Secretary.
In those days it was usual for officers, especially
young officers, to go where they were sent, without
previous reference and without room for remonstrance.
Nearly twenty years passed before I was
again consulted as to my posting. Recently a different
practice seems to have developed. Although
from a financial point of view the move to Rangoon
was ruinous, we decided to risk it and went down.
Except for two brief intervals, I stayed in the
Secretariat till early in 1891. Altogether I spent in
the office eleven years, a period surpassed only, I
think, by my friend Mr. C. G. Bayne.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> In 1883
Mr. Symes was Secretary, Mr. Burgess being on
leave.</p>

<p>Life was much the same as when we were here
two years before. Rangoon was still a pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
social place. We rode in the mornings, and played
polo or tennis in the afternoons, gave a good many
hours to dancing and whist, went to the races twice
a year, and in the rains to hunts once a week.
Some were even so energetic as to play tennis two
or three times a week before breakfast, a practice
which our less hardy successors have abandoned.
We drove to office and out to dinner in dogcarts.
Not in those days did the Junior Secretary or his
wife regard a brougham as indispensable. Among
the pleasantest meetings were hunt finishes, hospitable
gatherings where, at the end of the run, riders
and their friends were rewarded with pegs and
encouraged to dance. Jests and laughter filled the
air. The cheerful subaltern leant over the veranda,
encouraging a reluctant rider at the last show-jump:
“Give him his head, sir; can’t you see the
pony wants to jump?” Poor Cockeram; one of the
first to fall in the guerilla warfare in Upper Burma.
The lotteries on the races were still fairly select
meetings of friends and acquaintances. In 1885
I attended them for the last time, and bandied
quips with a famous special correspondent. In
reply to his remark that we were making history,
I made the obvious and unluckily too true reply
that we left that to him. I am still somewhat surprised
that he, an Irishman, should have thought it
necessary gravely to explain the origin and meaning
of his observation.</p>

<p>The work in the Secretariat was hard enough, but
not so overwhelming as in later times. There was
a staff of good old-fashioned clerks, most of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
had been in the office many years, whose experience
compensated the somewhat primitive methods inherited
from days when Sir Arthur Phayre himself
went daily to the Secretariat in Godwin Road. The
office was quite efficient, bearing the impress of three
excellent Secretaries, Major Street, Mr. Burgess,
and Mr. Symes, each of the finest quality in his
own way. Mr. Crosthwaite, whose name is associated
with Burma more intensely than that of anyone
save Sir Arthur Phayre, acted as Chief Commissioner
for a year in 1883-84, during Mr. Bernard’s absence
on leave.</p>

<p>About this time India was violently agitated by
the Ilbert Bill. In all parts of India the bulk of the
magisterial work is done by native officers. Living
in places more or less remote were many Europeans,
planters and others, whom it was thought undesirable
to subject to the jurisdiction of Indians. The
law therefore ordained that only magistrates themselves
Europeans and of proved experience should
exercise powers in criminal cases over persons classed
as European British subjects. This was, I venture
to say, a wise and necessary provision. By the
Ilbert Bill it was proposed to abolish this distinction
and to place Europeans and natives on the same
footing in respect of criminal procedure. It was a
doctrinaire proposal of the worst kind, subversive of
the prestige of the ruling race, and quite uncalled
for by the circumstances and exigencies of the time.
One thing only can be said in its favour. It was
offered as a voluntary boon, not as a concession to
seditious clamour and agitation. By all classes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Europeans the proposal was vehemently opposed.
In many parts, especially in Bengal, passionate
excitement was stirred up. The Viceroy, believed
to have been the only begetter of the Bill, seated on
the Olympian heights of Simla, failed to realize the
extent and force of the opposition to his project.
Not till he came down to Calcutta did he understand
the situation. In the capital there was
enough visible ferment to indicate the seething
passions beneath. Wild stories are told of the
intentions of the European community, had the Bill
been pressed. If Lord Ripon had not come to
Calcutta, he would have continued in ignorance,
surrounded only by officials, unblest by the saving
grace of contact with living public opinion. In
Burma alone among the Provinces of India, the
subject failed to kindle a spark of vital interest.
There were few Europeans scattered through the
country likely to be affected by the proposed change
in the law. And, for reasons which it would not be
difficult to analyze, Europeans in Burma have
seldom been very clamorous in expression. By
some of the more ardent spirits, however, it was
felt that Rangoon ought not to be left entirely out
of the movement. After much delay, a meeting to
demonstrate and protest against the Bill was convened
at Mr. Fowle’s new Town Hall for one fine
Saturday afternoon. On the morning of the appointed
day, the <i>Rangoon Gazette</i> published in
advance an account of the meeting, with the names
of the speakers very thinly disguised, and with
parodies of the speeches they were expected to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
deliver. The plot was hatched in the Secretariat.
Though I was <i>pars exigua</i>, the account was mainly
written by Mr. Bayne. The secret was never
disclosed, and the incident has no doubt long ago
been forgotten. At the time our <i>jeu d’esprit</i> had a
<i>succès fou</i>. This we knew by the wealth of abuse
heaped on our unknown heads by correspondents of
the rival newspaper, the <i>Rangoon Times</i>. Further
ill-luck attended the meeting. Just before it
opened, news came that a compromise had been
effected, and that substantial modifications were to
be made in the Bill. The meeting was held, and
speeches, much as we had foretold, were delivered,
but as the measure was already dead the demonstration
fell rather flat.</p>

<p>For two or three months in 1884 I acted as
Revenue Secretary and Director of Agriculture.
In that capacity I signed and issued the first of the
annual forecasts of the exportable surplus of the rice-crop.
Candour compels me to confess that the
signature was all that I contributed to this or any
later forecast. For the first Mr. Bernard was
entirely responsible. With some misgiving he
raised the figure to 975,000 tons. These forecasts
have been issued year by year ever since, and on the
average have been so close to the actuals as to
evoke the expressed admiration of the mercantile
community. The latest forecast predicted a surplus
of over 2,600,000 tons, a remarkable increase in less
than thirty years.</p>

<p>By another stroke of luck I acted as Secretary
for three months early in 1885 in place of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Symes on privilege leave. Later in the year, owing
to Mr. Burgess’s return for a short time to the
Secretariat, I had my last experience of subdivisional
work. My̆anaung, just above the Delta, but not in
the dry tract, was one of the most charming subdivisions.
The Deputy-Commissioner, Mr. A. M. B.
Irwin,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> was most able and genial, an admirable
chief whose knowledge of district work has never
been surpassed. These months were pleasant and
restful after the somewhat strenuous life of the
Secretariat. The duties were light, the house comfortable,
the riding good. Now a railway runs
through the subdivision, but till recently all travelling
was by unmetalled roads, jungle paths, and
along the embankment which restrained the river.
Two township officers, one at Kanaung, one at
Kyangin, shared the ordinary work.</p>

<p>Among the reforms introduced by Mr. Bernard
was the selection of a certain proportion of My̆o-ôks
by competitive examination. My̆o-ôks, it will be
remembered, are officers, generally natives of the
Province, who have charge of townships. Previously
they had been appointed by Government solely on
the recommendation of Commissioners and other
high officers. Mr. Bernard devised a system combining
nomination and competition. But a great
many direct appointments were still made. The
system is still in force except that recently I threw
the competitive examination open to all young men
of good health and character. On the whole the
plan has worked well. A great many of the My̆o-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>ôks
appointed after examination have proved themselves
very valuable officers. I agree that many of
our best My̆o-ôks and Extra Assistant Commissioners
have been men of character and integrity, well
educated in their own language, but hardly likely to
secure appointments by open competition. No one
appreciates these men more highly than I do. But
the scheme of administration becomes yearly more
complex. And in an increasing number of offices a
good knowledge of English is essential. By the
competitive system, if a high standard is maintained,
some of the best among the educated youth are
attracted to Government service, while the reservation
of a number of posts for direct appointment
keeps open the door for those who are distinguished
by birth and character rather than by academic
aptitude. The objection that under the open competitive
system we have no guarantee of candidates’
social standing has very little weight in Burma. It
is a country where fraternity and equality are
realities, where class distinctions are of little value.
One of my My̆o-ôks was of the old school. Formerly
a pleader, he had earned his appointment by being
instrumental in the capture of the Myingun Prince.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
The other was a competitioner, and not perhaps a
good example of my thesis. A man of good educa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>tion
who had been a schoolmaster, he seems to have
missed his vocation by becoming a Judge and
magistrate. His wife, a clever bustling woman,
was thought to supply some of her husband’s
deficiencies. It was said, probably untruly, that on
occasion she would come into Court and stir up the
peons<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and punka-pullers. The My̆o-ôk’s house was
a pleasant place to visit. He had two charming
little daughters of tender years, who, in a most
engaging way, used to stand up and recite to
visitors “Lord Ullin’s Daughter,” and other English
verses. My friend afterwards resumed his original
profession, which no doubt suited him better. His
son is an officer of great ability and distinction.</p>

<p>Recalling my quiet life at My̆anaung, I am reminded
of some instances of Burmese superstition.
Some fishermen of that place before starting work
made the customary offerings to nats. One of them
placed his offering of rice in a dish from which the
dogs were fed. His companions exclaimed at this
impious act and warned him of the consequences.
That day, when they were all in their boats, a
monstrous crocodile appeared. “See,” said the
fishermen, “the result of your wickedness.” The
offender took no heed of the warning, but next day
repeated his insult to the nats. So he filled the cup
of his iniquity. That morning, in the midst of the
fishing, the crocodile again appeared. This time the
contemner of nats was knocked out of his boat and
perished in the waters.</p>

<p>Burmans are firm believers in ghosts, know well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the danger of passing graveyards after dark, and are
convinced of the existence of good and evil spirits.
I remember one curious case in which superstitious
terror had a lamentable issue. In the middle of the
rains a man was cutting grass in a field. The rain
pattered noisily on his kamauk.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Suddenly he
heard close behind him what sounded like an unearthly
voice. In a panic he turned hastily and
made a cut with his sickle-shaped knife, unhappily
with fatal effect. The speaker was a harmless
villager, whose voice, by evil chance, was singularly
gruff. In a moment, recognizing the catastrophe,
the grass-cutter gave his best attention to the victim
of his fear, but in vain. The police quaintly reported
that the man had cut in the direction of the
sound, “thinking it was a devil, but admitted that
he was mistaken.” I am glad to say that we were
not so pedantic as to bring the grass-cutter to trial
for his misadventure which he sincerely regretted.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
THE TAKING OF MANDALAY</h2>

<p>Mr. Burgess having gone to act as Commissioner, I
was recalled to the Secretariat in some haste, in my
former capacity as Junior Secretary. It was in the
midst of the excitement of a probable rupture with
Upper Burma. Our relations with the Court of
Mandalay had long ceased to be cordial. So long
ago as 1879 our representative had been withdrawn,
and such communications as were necessary with the
Burmese Government had been conducted by letter.
In the absence of the Resident matters gradually
drifted from bad to worse. British subjects,
travellers and traders from Lower Burma, were
subjected to insult and violence by local officials,
and representations to the central authority demanding
redress were generally fruitless. In contravention
of the express terms of the Treaty of 1867,
monopolies were created to the detriment of trade
both in Upper and Lower Burma. Owing to the
weakness and corruption of the Burmese Government,
society became thoroughly disorganized, so
that turbulent tracts on the frontier became a
standing menace to the peace of our districts. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the same time, the Burmese Government showed a
marked and persistent anxiety to enter into alliances
with foreign Powers, in such a manner and to such
an extent as to give ground for apprehension that
grave political trouble might result. While the
Indian Government was unrepresented in Mandalay,
representatives of France and Italy were welcomed,
and two separate embassies were sent to Europe,
one under the guise of a merely commercial mission,
for the purpose of contracting new and if possible
close alliances with European Powers. Neither of
these missions visited England or showed any desire
to win the friendship of representatives of the British
Government at the Courts to which the Burmese
envoys were accredited. Throughout the reign of
King Mindôn, young scions of families of leading
men about the Court were sent to England, France,
and Italy to study the language and manners of
European countries. In the reign of his successor
this policy was continued, with the studied omission
of England.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Having no Resident, we had to find means of
keeping ourselves informed of events in Mandalay.
One of our correspondents was Mr. A. E. Rawlings,
the Postmaster, who for a moderate subsidy wrote
periodical news-letters to the Secretary. He sent
much useful and interesting matter. There was
also another correspondent whose reports were extraordinarily
accurate and instructive, and from whose
keen vision no secret transaction was hidden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>It has always seemed to me that the proximate
cause of the annexation of Upper Burma was the
patriotic and enlightened Minister known as the
Kinwun Mingyi. Some years before, this gentleman
had travelled in Europe as head of a commercial
mission, and had been received with great distinction.
His progress was a triumph; insignia of
Continental orders, illuminated addresses of English
manufacturing towns, were showered upon him as if
he had been Minister of the Great Mogul. To us
who realize the insignificance of the King of Burma
as a potentate, these proceedings savour of the
ridiculous. During this visit the Kinwun Mingyi
obtained some superficial knowledge of European
politics and of the relations between the Great
Powers. Many years later, when there was no
longer a British Resident at Mandalay, and when
the path seemed clear of obstacles, the Mingyi conceived
the ingenious plan of contracting political
relations and making treaties with several States,
such as France, Germany, and Italy. The subtle
intention was to play off one against another, so
that, while none would have predominant influence,
all would be interested in opposing and thwarting
the ambitious designs of Great Britain. There was
some statesmanship in the project, but not quite
enough; and with the best intentions the Mingyi
compassed the downfall of the dynasty of which he
was a devoted servant. By the autumn of 1885
negotiations with France had made good progress.
A French Consul was appointed to Mandalay, and
plans for the foundation of a French bank were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
initiated. A treaty was provisionally concluded,
though never formally ratified. The ostensible
cause of the rupture with the Burmese Court was
the imposition of an enormous fine on the Bombay
Burma Trading Corporation, a British company
carrying on extensive operations in Upper Burma
forests. Probably in any case the British Government
would have intervened, on account of the treatment
received by the Corporation. But the ultimate
cause of intervention was the apprehension lest
France or some other European Power should establish
a preponderant influence in Upper Burma, and
create a situation which would render our position
in Lower Burma intolerable.</p>

<p>When I got back to Rangoon, the preliminary
correspondence with India and Mandalay was
starting. It was all desperately urgent and deadly
secret, and the Chief Commissioner and his Secretary
were more than fully occupied. The Burmese
answer to our first representation was deliberately
curt and discourteous. Under the orders of the
Government of India an ultimatum was therefore
sent to the King of Burma. He was required to
suspend the execution of the decree against the
Corporation, to receive at Mandalay an envoy from
the Viceroy with a view to the settlement of the
matter in issue, and for the future to permit the
residence at the capital of an agent of the Indian
Government, who should be received and treated
with the respect due to the Government which he
represented. It was further intimated that the
Burmese Government would be required to regulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
its external relations in accordance with advice of
the Government of India, and to afford facilities for
opening up British trade with China.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The ultimatum was despatched on the 22nd of
October, 1885. It was taken by Captain Cooper, of
the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company, on the steamer
<i>Ashley Eden</i>, which went specially to Mandalay for
the purpose. An answer was required by the 10th of
November. In default of receiving a reply Captain
Cooper was instructed to leave Mandalay on a fixed
date. The mission was of a hazardous nature.
Captain Cooper discharged it with intrepidity and
skill. He remained with his steamer fires banked,
and he returned bearing the haughty and uncompromising
answer of the Burmese Government. As
he passed down the river he ran the gauntlet of the
fire of forts on the bank. Such was the Burmese
notion of the courtesy due to envoys. The answer was
received in Rangoon on the 9th of November. Two
days earlier the King of Burma issued a proclamation
calling on his subjects to rally round him to resist
the unjust demands of the British Government, and
expressing his determination to efface these heretic
foreigners and conquer and annex their country.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>When the ultimatum was considered by the
Burmese Court and Government, there seems to
have been a division of counsel. The two highest
officers of State were two Mingyis, the virtuous
and temperate Kinwun, the corrupt and blood-thirsty
Taingda. The Queen, Sûpăya-lât, was
certainly present when the situation was discussed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
The Kinwun advised moderation and diplomacy;
the Taingda was for blood and fury. The Queen’s
voice was for resistance. She had the unexampled
impertinence to tell the Kinwun Mingyi, a man of
mature and reverend years, her father’s trusted
Councillor, that when she had beaten the English
she would dress him in a tamein<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and send him to
live among the women. The counsels of unreason
prevailed. The proclamation was issued, and futile
resistance was undertaken.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in anticipation of an unfavourable
reply to the ultimatum, preparations for the advance
on Mandalay had been rapidly made. The speed
with which the expedition was organized and set
in motion was almost incredible. The first orders for
the mobilization of troops were issued by Government
of India on or about the 19th of October; the
expeditionary force crossed the frontier on the 14th
of November, 1885. The force was of all arms,
including some Madras Cavalry and some mounted
infantry. Except the detachment of the Rangoon
Volunteer Rifles, which patriotically volunteered for
active service, all the troops were sent from India.
For the promptitude of the despatch from Rangoon,
the chief credit is due to Mr. Bernard himself, who
placed all the resources of his position and all his
personal energy and experience at the disposal of
the military authorities. Every day saw him on
the river-bank supervising and urging on the preparations.
Much praise is due also to the Irrawaddy
Flotilla Company, which made every vessel of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
fleet available and carried the whole expedition. Of
course, this was not all pure patriotism on the part
of the Company; but the service rendered by them
was of inestimable value, and contributed largely to
the brilliant success of the operations. The command
of the force was entrusted to Major-General
Harry Prendergast, V.C.,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> a most gallant and distinguished
officer, who had already served in Burma,
and was thus specially qualified for the appointment.
Already, in the pursuit of intelligence, he had even
penetrated into Upper Burma in peaceful guise.
In command of brigades were Brigadier-General
G. S. White, V.C.,<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Brigadier-General Norman, and
Brigadier-General Forde; while the staff included
Major W. P. Symons,<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> then at the beginning of a
glorious career. The troops were specially enjoined
to treat the people of the country with kindness and
consideration. One precept directed that in addressing
a Burman the soldier should say “Kinbya,” not
“Hey, Johnny!” A book of Burmese phrases,
laboriously compiled by a gentleman unacquainted
with the language, was profusely distributed. It is
pleasant to be able to record, with perfect honesty,
that never did army of occupation behave with more
restraint and moderation, or more readily win the
esteem and respect of a subject people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chief Civil and Political Officer with the
expedition was Colonel E. B. Sladen<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> of the Burma
Commission. Four young officers Mr. R. Phayre,
C.S.,<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Mr. A. S. Fleming, C.S., Captain G. S. Eyre,
of the Commission, and Mr. G. G. Collins accompanied
the force as civil officers. Mr. R. C. Stevenson,
also of the police, one of the foremost Burmese
scholars, was attached to General Prendergast as
chief interpreter.</p>

<p>On the 14th November the frontier was crossed,
on the 17th Minhla, on the 23rd Pagan, on the
25th Myingyan were successively occupied. Except
at Minhla, where the fort which still stands on the
river-bank was not taken without a brisk fight,
scarcely any resistance was encountered. And as
the flotilla moved up the river, even in Mandalay
the determination to resist began to fail. Just
before the expedition reached Ava the Kinwun
Mingyi arrived, and after some negotiation arranged
the unconditional surrender of the capital and of the
Royal Family. On the 26th and 27th November
the forts at Ava and Sagaing were given up, and
the troops at Ava laid down their arms. On the
28th the flotilla moored off the town, and General
Prendergast occupied Mandalay. The city and the
palace were surrounded, while Colonel Sladen, with
the cool courage which was his best distinction,
entered the palace alone, and remained there for a
day and a night, settling the details of the King’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
surrender. Next day, in a little summer-house in
the palace garden, King Thebaw gave himself up to
the victorious General, and the dynasty of Alaungpăyá
ruled no more. After all, it was a mushroom
growth, having held sway for little more than 130
years.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The King and his two Queens, with their
mother and her eldest daughter, were driven through
the streets of Mandalay in little bullock-drawn
carriages, the only vehicles available. They were
placed on board the steamer <i>Thooreah</i>, and conveyed
to Rangoon. The flimsy little summer-house fell
into decay, and no longer exists. The tablet which
marks its site, and commemorates the most striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
event in its history, will doubtless remain as long
as the British flag flies over Mandalay.</p>

<p>The first report of the King’s surrender reached
Rangoon in a non-official telegram. By luck or
good management we were enabled to telegraph the
tidings simultaneously to the Secretary of State,
and to save his Lordship from the shock of receiving
the first intimation of the fall of Mandalay from his
morning paper. Of course, the telegraph line was
interrupted. This message came from Tha-yet-my̆o,
brought thither by the King’s steamer.</p>

<p>As the junior officer in the Secretariat, I was told
off to board the <i>Thooreah</i> on her arrival. I was thus
the first officer in Rangoon to see the ex-King and
his Queens. King Thebaw was in appearance a
Burman of very ordinary type. He looked neither
dissipated nor cruel; nor did he show any emotion
or feeling of his melancholy position. His somewhat
heavy features were unmistakably those of the
House of Alaungpăyá. Both he and his elder sister
(who died not long ago) closely resembled the familiar
picture of Mindôn Min. Queen Sūpăyá-lāt’s features
were more finely marked than is usual with Burmese
ladies. She bore no appearance of special depravity,
but she certainly looked a little shrew. The legend
of Sūpăyá-lāt is that she was a monster of cruelty
and wickedness, and that she was mainly responsible
for all acts of State during her husband’s reign.
From all that I heard in Mandalay, where I had
many sources of information, for the most part
unfriendly to the ex-Queen, I believe that both her
wickedness and her influence have been much ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>aggerated.
She seems to have been of a jealous
temper, and to have checked any inclination on the
part of her husband to follow the footsteps of
Mindôn Min. Doubtless it went hard with any
maid who attracted the King’s attention. On one
of the golden doors of the palace used to be shown
bloodstains, marks of a little hand, signs of the
tragic end of a Princess who had incurred the
Queen’s wrath. (I am aware of the learned explanation
of these marks, but the legend is far more
interesting.) Beyond this there is no credible
evidence of her cruelty, nor is it well established
that she ruled the State. Clearly she wielded some
influence; but apart from the story of her speech
to the Kinwun Mingyi, the most arrogant action
imputed to her was that she used to have her meals
before the King. Of course, this was very unusual
and unseemly for a Burmese woman of any class.
It hardly shows that she was paramount in the
direction of the kingdom. The royal exiles were
transferred to the R.I.M.S. <i>Clive</i>, and, after remaining
for a few days in Rangoon, were taken to
Madras. They were finally transferred to Ratnagiri
in the Bombay Presidency, where King Thebaw
and Sūpăyá-lāt still live. The poor little second
Queen, of whom nothing, good or bad, has ever
been heard, died last year. An irresponsible journalist
lately suggested that Ratnagiri was an unsuitable
place of abode for these fallen dignitaries. It is one
of the best places that could be chosen. They and
their family have been quite healthy. As they
cannot be allowed to return to Burma, they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
likely to be as contented there as elsewhere. Two
of the Ministers and a few retainers were with difficulty
persuaded to accompany their fallen master.
The Ministers speedily returned to Mandalay. So
did most of the retainers after one little Chin maid
had given some trouble by running up a tree and
declining to come down, because Sūpăyá-lāt, whose
temper misfortune may have sharpened, had smacked
her.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which the conquest of the
Burmese King was effected must always be a subject
of astonishment. Many times in the previous wars
Burmese soldiers had offered stout resistance, fighting
fiercely behind stockades. That the martial
spirit still survived was abundantly shown afterwards
in the years of desultory fighting described in
Sir Charles Crosthwaite’s classic history of the
pacification of Burma. The truth is, the central
Government was rotten at the core, corrupt and
inefficient and singularly impecunious. The balance
found in the Treasury at Mandalay was about
£5,000, not a very large sum to finance a war.
There was no organized Burmese army, with
captains versed in the art of war, capable of meeting
in the field disciplined troops under trained
leaders. But the main cause of the downfall of the
Burmese kingdom, with hardly a blow struck in its
defence, was no doubt the speed with which preparations
for the advance were made, and the skill,
swiftness, and resolution with which General Prendergast
directed the progress to Mandalay. If a
little more time had been allowed to the Burmese,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the ascent would have been more arduous, though
not less effectual. The celerity with which the
operations were carried out is probably paralleled
in history only by the advance of the Balkan armies
towards Constantinople.</p>

<p>While opposition to the main force was feeble and
faint-hearted, at the outset of hostilities reprisals
were taken on Englishmen employed in the forests
or on the river. It was, indeed, only by the
humanity or prudence of some local officials that any
of these isolated Englishmen escaped. A Thandawzin<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
was sent to deal with Bombay-Burma men on
the Chindwin. Four of them were barbarously
murdered. The murderer was Thandawzin So Bôn,
who disappeared immediately. I sought him diligently,
but in vain, for nearly twenty-five years.
If he still lives, this record of his name may yet
bring to him the reward of his crime. Four other
forest men were saved by the intervention of the
Wun<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> of Mingin.</p>

<p>Upper Burma had long been the refuge of persons
who had pressing reasons for leaving Lower Burma;
in fact, as one departmental Report said, it was a
“perfect Arcadia.” Not only thieves, robbers,
dacoits, and murderers, but the bailiff who had lost
at Komi the proceeds of Court sales, the Postmaster
who was short in his collections, the clerk who had
stolen witnesses’ subsistence money, all found an
asylum across the border. Demands for extradition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
were made, but practically never with any effect.
The Wun of Mingin was among many who felt it
necessary to take measures for their security if, as
seemed likely, Upper Burma came under British
rule. Long years ago, this astute man had been
Akunwun<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> of the rich district of Rangoon or
Hanthawaddy. One morning, having packed on
elephants the contents of the Treasury, some lakhs
of rupees, he fled with his plunder across the frontier.
There, with his wicked prize, he was a man of importance,
obtained office, and in process of time was
placed in charge of Mingin on the Chindwin River.
Partly moved by humanity, for he was as kindly a
man as ever scooped a Treasury, partly, I surmise,
because he was shrewd enough to foresee the downfall
of the Burmese Government, he protected the
Bombay-Burma men who fell into his hands, saved
them from ill-usage and death, and made them over
to a small British force which early visited the
Chindwin. The Wun’s humanity was suitably
rewarded. His delinquency was condoned and he
became a My̆o-ôk. Though he was believed always
to be tainted with the corrupt habits of Upper
Burma, he served us moderately well. The fact that
he had saved the lives of our countrymen was never
forgotten and would have covered many sins.
Finally, he died in his bed, up to the day of his
death in receipt of a pension from Government. I
knew very well both him and his wife, who had
accompanied him in his flight from Rangoon.
Naturally, we did not in plain words discuss that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
incident. But reference to early days was sometimes
made, and the old lady admitted that the
Wun had been frivolous and light-hearted in his
youth. When I knew him, he was grave and
reverend. This is not the only instance in which
persons guilty of past offences in Lower Burma
purged their guilt by good service in troubled times
and were received back into Government employ.
I found it convenient to keep in mind their
histories.</p>

<p>Another case of the cruel treatment of Europeans
was the seizure of a Flotilla steamer at Moda, between
Mandalay and Bhamo, and the imprisonment
and ill-treatment of crew and officers. Daily was
Captain Redman led out as if to execution. He,
too, escaped by some friendly intervention, or the
hesitation of his captors to proceed to the last
extremity. He was, however, very badly used.
The two local officers responsible for these barbarities
were brought down to Mandalay, fined and imprisoned,
and publicly whipped by the Chief Commissioner’s
order.</p>

EARLY DAYS AT MANDALAY</h2>

<p>As speedily as possible, Mr. Bernard went up to
Mandalay, leaving Lower Burma practically under
the administration of the Secretary, Mr. Symes.
He went up in the old R.I.M.S. <i>Irrawaddy</i>, embarking
at Prome. With him were a few civil and
police officers, destined with those who had accompanied
the expedition to form the nucleus of the
Civil Administration. Colonel T. Lowndes,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Inspector-General
of Police, Captain C. H. E. Adamson,<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
of the Commission, Mr. G. M. S. Carter,
and Mr. M. J. Chisholm, of the Police, were on
board, and I had the luck to go as Junior Secretary.
We landed at Minhla and inspected the
fort, now garrisoned by Bengal Infantry, and the
scene of the fight; at Myingyan, where we saw
marks of our cannonade; at Pakôkku, where the
Chief Commissioner was received by the My̆othugyi-gadaw,<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
a lady of large bulk, of high spirit, and of
cheerful humour, who was administering the town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
and district in the name of her son. The old lady
was extremely affable, and professed loyalty to the
new Government. To the best of her ability, I
believe she carried out her engagement. Her position
was quite in accordance with the practice in
Burma, where, as already stated, women take a
prominent part in public affairs. She survived for
some years, and was always our good friend.</p>

<p>On the 15th of December, 1885, Mr. Bernard
arrived at Mandalay, and, with his staff, took up his
quarters in the Palace where Sir Harry Prendergast
and his officers were already installed. Mr. Bernard
occupied a set of rooms behind the Eastern Audience
Hall. Colonel Lowndes and I shook down in some
good masonry buildings hard by, which had been
used as waiting-rooms by the Ministers coming to
transact business with the King. My abode was
immediately under the wooden tower in the south-east
corner of the palace, whence Queen Sūpăyá-lāt
is said, the legend is apocryphal, to have viewed
the march of the British force from the shore to
the city. Behind me was the shed of the White
Elephant, which had died a few days after the
occupation, feeling, no doubt, that his use was at an
end. Opposite, fronted by a pillared terrace, in the
midst of which played a fountain, was a charming
pavilion faced with white stucco, of modern design
and construction, used by the King as a morning-room.
Mr. Bernard adopted it for the same purpose.
We were all most kindly made honorary
members of the Headquarter Mess, established in
spacious rooms adjacent to the Royal Theatre.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
There, with the chief military officers, we dined
every night, and often played a quiet rubber. For
breakfast and luncheon, during his stay in Mandalay,
Mr. Bernard kept open house for his staff. Mr.
Bernard’s breakfasts were refreshing interludes in
the busy round of official work. Round that hospitable
board often sat welcome guests, visitors of
distinction, officers passing through Mandalay bringing
a breath of the old world to our new heritage.
From time to time every member of the Viceroy’s
Council came to see the latest kingdom added to
the Empire. Perhaps the visitor who made the
deepest impression was Sir George Chesney, Military
Member of Council, a man of wide culture and
literary distinction, moving on a higher plane than
the ordinary Indian official. (No offence to the
ordinary official, honest man, whose stock of late
years has unjustly depreciated.) Sir George Chesney
seemed to have a wider range, a more extensive
outlook; his premature death deprived the world of
a statesman. In very early days came to Mandalay,
as the Chief Commissioner’s guests, some charming
Americans, among them a lady of exceptional grace
and beauty. Warned by secretaries and aides-de-camp
that she could not possibly go to Mandalay,
where conditions of war still obtained, she is said
to have gone pouting to the great Lord Sahib, by
whom she was assured that she should certainly
go, and that her path should be strewn with roses.
’Twere churlish not to believe this pretty story.
My impression is that the men of the party
tried to buy the Palace as it stood, and succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
in acquiring a gilded sentry-box. I may wrong
them.</p>

<p>Most strange and almost incredible it seemed to
range at will the halls and corridors, where hardly a
fortnight before the Lord of many White Elephants
had kept his State. The Palace was in exactly the
same condition as when occupied by the Burmese
Court. As a Burman official said, in another place,
the scene was the same, the actors only were
changed. Barbarous Byzantine mirrors of colossal
size still lined the walls; a motley heap of modern
toys, French clocks and fans, mechanical singing
birds, and the like, mingled with lovely specimens
of Burmese carving, gold and silver and lacquered
trays and boxes, forming a heterogeneous collection
characteristic of degenerate taste. Rooms so lately
tenanted by King, Queens, and their butterfly
attendants, aglow with light and colour, were now
occupied as sober offices and quarters. Khaki
uniforms, boots, and the ringing of spurs replaced
gay pasos and tameins and soft pattering of naked
feet. The Palace, it must be confessed, was a mass
of somewhat tawdry buildings, mostly of wood and
of no great antiquity, desecrated by corrugated iron
roofs, yet of interest as a unique specimen of Burmese
domestic architecture. Perhaps the most
striking features were the great halls of audience,
supported by mighty pillars of teak, red and golden,
the several Royal thrones often described, and the
Py̆athat, the graceful terraced spire surmounting
the eastern throne-room, which travellers have been
taught to call the Centre of the Universe. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
title was invented by an enterprising journalist, but
will, no doubt, always be cited as a mark of Burmese
arrogance. Besides the rooms reserved for the
King, then occupied by Sir Harry Prendergast, the
Palace afforded accommodation for the Queens and
for Ambassadors, attendants, pages, maids of honour,
and the usual entourage of an Eastern Court. For
some years the Palace continued to be inhabited.
The King’s audience-hall was used as a church; the
corresponding hall on the west, the Queen’s, as a
club house. A few of the buildings on the Palace
platform were of masonry work, built for the King
by some of the foreigners who swarmed at the
Burmese Court. Like the famous A-tu-ma-shi<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
monastery, these made no pretence of being in
Burmese style, and were grievous to the æsthetic
eye. In the Palace enclosure was the Council
Chamber where the Hlutdaw<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> deliberated. Opposite
was a model of the Kyaung,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> where King
Thebaw spent his novitiate. This also was for
some time used as a church. All round the Palace
were charming gardens, intersected by watercourses,
with many a grotto and pavilion, where gay young
Princes and Princesses, pages and maids of honour,
idled away the pleasant hours. Girdling and protecting
the Palace and its precincts was an inner
wall of masonry, and round this again a palisade of
stout teak logs. The main gates of the palace corresponded
with those of the city. Just within the
eastern gate stood a white tower, the Bohozin,
whereon was a mighty drum, the Bohozi, struck by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
hereditary beaters to record the hour and to assure
the world that the King was in his palace. After
the occupation, the beaters fled. We were gravely
warned that the silence of the Bohozi would be
interpreted as a sign that anarchy prevailed and
that there was no Government. The beaters were
sought out and reinstated. As soon as the
periodical sound of the drum was heard once more,
we were solemnly advised that this would never do.
The beating of the Bohozi indicated that the
<i>Burmese</i> Government still existed, and that we were
merely temporary sojourners. So the beaters were
retired on suitable terms, and the Bohozi was sent
to the Phayre Museum. I need hardly say that it
did not matter a brass farthing whether the drum
was beaten or not.</p>

<p>The Palace stood in the middle of what we came
to call the city. Built on somewhat high ground
about three miles from the shore, the city (myo) was
a perfect square, surrounded by a rampart of earth,
battlemented walls, and a moat on which water-lilies
floated in lovely profusion. Each face of the walls
measured one mile and a quarter. Between the
walls and the moat was a stretch of turf, as if
expressly provided for a morning gallop, but somewhat
spoilt by sudden holes. Five great gates,
two on the west, one on each other side, opened
through the wall, each approached by a bridge over
the moat. At every gate was a red wooden pillar,
with an inscription recording the date and circumstances
of its erection. Stories, which we need not
believe, are told of the burial of living victims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
beneath these pillars. Within the city walls, all
round the palace, the space was closely packed with
Burmese houses. Here were the dwellings of
Ministers and other high officers, each surrounded
by an ample compound (win) where lived a whole
village of relations and retainers. Here also were
the humbler dwellings of minor officials, soldiers,
and the miscellaneous rabble collected about an
Eastern Court.</p>

<p>Now all is changed. The Palace remains a
melancholy memento of Burmese sovereignty. The
halls are tenantless, and the footstep of the infrequent
visitor rings hollow on its floors. A fragment
of the teak stockade is preserved. The rest is
replaced by a neat post and rail fence. All the
native houses have disappeared. The space within
the walls is occupied by barracks, mess-houses,
dwellings, polo-ground, and the like. The last
Burmese house, now removed, was that of the
Kinwun Mingyi.</p>

<p class="caption smcap">The City Wall, Mandalay.</p>
</div>

<p>The town, as distinguished from the city, extended
to the river on the west and to Amarapura on the
south, peopled mostly by non-officials living in
wooden houses and bamboo huts, with here and
there a white masonry building, the dwelling of an
Indian trader. In the midst was the great bazaar,
the Zegyo. An embankment protected the low-lying
land from the river in flood. Through the town
crept the Shwe-ta-chaung, a malodorous stream, on
whose banks still stood the old British Residency
in a grove of tamarind-trees. While in the city
the roads were straight and hard, the streets of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
town were unmetalled, alternately dust and mud.
The first work undertaken by the army of occupation
was the construction of four roads to the shore.
With military simplicity, but perhaps with some
want of imagination, these were called A, B, C, and
D Roads, names which still cling to them. To the
south was the Yakaing Paya, commonly called the
Arakan Pagoda, the shrine of the great image of
Gaudama Buddha, brought across the hills from
Arakan. Second only in interest to the Shwe
Dagôn Pagoda, it attracted throngs of pilgrims. In
one of the courtyards reclined battered bronze statues
of magic virtue. If you had a pain, you rubbed the
correspondent part of one of these statues, and
obtained relief. In a neighbouring pond were sacred
turtles, who came at call to be fed.</p>

<p>East of the city rose the Shan Hills, with the
little hill of Yankintaung<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> alone in the middle
distance. The evening glow reflected on the
Eastern Hills misled the unobservant to rhapsodize
on the beautiful effect of the sun setting behind
Yankintaung. North stood Mandalay Hill, a cool
and pleasant height, ascended by stone steps or by
a winding bridle-path; near its pagoda-covered
summit towered a stately upright statue of the
Buddha, his right arm extended towards the city,
as it were the palladium of the capital. At the
foot lay the A-tu-ma-shi (the Incomparable Monastery),
a large white masonry structure of modern
design, built by an Italian. Here sat another
colossal image of the Buddha, in whose forehead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
sparkled a diamond of unequalled size and lustre.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
Hard by stood the Ku-tho-daw Păya,<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> surrounded
by a multitude of small shrines covering alabaster
slabs, on which was inscribed the Law of the Buddha.
This pious work commemorated its founder, the
Einshemin, Mindôn Min’s brother, who lost his
life in the rebellion of the Myingun Mintha in 1867.
Gone now are the Incomparable Monastery and the
statue on the hill, both accidentally destroyed by
fire some years later.</p>

<p>In December, 1885, the situation in Mandalay,
and, indeed, in Upper Burma generally, was very
curious. Sir Harry Prendergast was in supreme
military command. Colonel Sladen was the chief
civil authority. The future of Upper Burma was
still under discussion between the Chief Commissioner,
the Government of India, and the Secretary
of State (Lord Randolph Churchill). It might be
decided to annex the country, or it might be thought
better to set up a new King, and to make Upper
Burma a protected State. Pending the decision,
an attempt was made provisionally to carry on the
Government on the same lines as before the occupation.
Although the King of Burma was an absolute,
not a constitutional, monarch, there was a Council
of State (the Hlutdaw), an advisory and executive
body with no legislative powers. It consisted of
the Wungyis, or Mingyis, the four highest officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
of State; four Atwin Wuns, high officers of the
Palace; and four Wundauks, props or assistants of
the Wungyis. Under their orders was a crowd of
secretaries or clerks (Sayedawgyi). The country
was governed by Wuns, each of whom administered
a local area, and received orders from the Hlutdaw
collectively, or from individual members thereof.
Mandalay was in charge of two Myowuns (town
magistrates), the Myowun U Pe Si,<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and the
Shwehlan Myowun. Temporarily, the Hlutdaw
was maintained in its powers and functions, the
place of the King being taken by Colonel Sladen.
There was one important innovation. Over all was
the Chief Commissioner. The Hlutdaw issued a
proclamation to all Wuns and local officers, directing
them to carry on their duties as before under the
command of the Central Government. British
officers in charge of districts Captain Eyre at
Pagan, Mr. Robert Phayre at Minhla, Mr. Collins
at Myingyan, Mr. Fleming at Shwebo were not
subordinated to the control of the Hlutdaw.
Mandalay also was removed from their control. At
first Mr. Fforde<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> as District Superintendent of
Police, then Captain Adamson as Deputy Commissioner,
with Mr. Fforde as his chief aid, were in
charge. These officers received most valuable help
from U Pe Si, who threw in his lot with the new
Government, and served it loyally and well for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
rest of his life. U Pe Si was one of the most interesting
characters of the annexation period. Of an
established official family, his grandfather having
been one of the signatories of the Treaty of Yandabo
in 1826, he was a man of courage and resource, well
fitted to be the colleague of British officers. His
knowledge of Mandalay and the surrounding district
was intimate and extensive. His mind was acute
and his judgment sound. At sixty, so old and frail
in appearance that he was once introduced to a
high officer as “the Yenangyaung Mingyi over
ninety years of age,” that fragile frame was informed
with dauntless will and resolution. He maintained
the closest relations with a succession of Deputy
Commissioners and Commissioners of Mandalay.
His practice was to drop in to breakfast and consume
vast quantities of jam, to the detriment of his
poor digestion, as an aid to the delivery of wise
discourse on men and things. Without him the task
of governing Mandalay, difficult at the best, would
have been still more arduous.</p>

<p>Our early sway was of a patriarchal type. The
theory that the penalty should be made to fit the
offence was adopted by an ingenious magistrate who
knew his Burman. An instance recurs to me worthy
of Shahpesh, the Persian. Some gamblers were
brought up for judgment.</p>

<p>“So you like cards. Will you play a game with
me?” said the magistrate genially. “Please draw
three cards.”</p>

<p>Two aces and a two were shown.</p>

<p>“What a lucky man! Take four stripes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>The next man drew two kings and a five.</p>

<p>“Your luck is not so good. Receive twenty-five
stripes.”</p>

<p>And so on, to the delight of the public, and, we
may hope, of the players. Another accused in the
same case, hung about with cards and dice and
other instruments of gaming, was paraded through
the streets with his face to the tail of the pony on
which he sat.</p>

<p>Colonel Sladen had the royal temperament, and
was prepared to set right all the wrongs done by
his predecessor. In pursuance of this policy he
restored to the Yenangyaung Mingyi and the
Pintha Mintha respectively all their property which
had been confiscated by the King. As soon as these
orders came to his notice, Mr. Bernard imperatively
forbade any further similar restitutions, rightly
holding it impossible to investigate the acts of the
Burmese Government in exercise of its sovereign
powers. The Yenangyaung Mingyi, then verging
on ninety, was a valued Minister of King Mindôn,
and had been wounded in the Myingun Prince’s
rebellion. On that occasion, as I heard from the
lips of an eyewitness, King Mindôn was attacked
by his disloyal son in a summer palace near Mandalay
Hill, and escaped borne on the back of a
faithful attendant. The Mingyi had fallen into disgrace
with King Thebaw, doubtless because he was
father of the Kyimyin Mipaya,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> one of Mindôn
Min’s lesser wives, who had borne the King a son,
the Pyinmana Mintha.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> In the massacre of 1879<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
this child’s life was spared, probably on account of
his extreme youth; but he and his mother and her
family all remained objects of suspicion, and were
kept in confinement by the Burmese Government.
Soon after our arrival the boy was discovered, and
sent to India and educated at an English school.
After 1905 he returned to Burma and settled in
Rangoon, where he still lives on excellent terms
with our officers. Restored to favour and fortune,
the Mingyi often came to see me, walking sturdily
in spite of his years, and usually accompanied by
two small sons of about eight or nine. The Pintha
Mintha was the brother of Yanaung Maung Tôk,<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
already mentioned as the roystering companion of
King Thebaw. These two titular Princes were sons
of another Yenangyaung Mingyi, of romantic history.
Sprung from humble stock, as a small boy he
attracted the notice of a Princess. She adopted and
educated him, and made him one of the royal pages.
Conspicuous for grace and courtesy of manner, and,
probably also for ability, he went on from rank to
rank till he became successively Atwin Wun, and,
on his death-bed, Mingyi. Though not of royal
blood, his sons were given the title of Mintha, as it
might be Prince Bismarck or Prince von Bülow.
Yanaung Maung Tôk had the repute of being a
blustering, truculent ruffian. If that was so, Pintha
Maung Byaung alone inherited his father’s gracious
qualities. I knew him well. A pleasanter, more
courteous, more polished gentleman could not be
found. His wife, who, I regret to say, died last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
year, was of a good official family, and a lady of
exceptional charm. Their sons are doing well in
Government service. Their daughters, delightful
young girls in their early teens, glittering with
diamonds and rubies, created a sensation at the
celebration of Queen Victoria’s Jubilee in 1887.
All three married well, but only one survives, the
happy wife of a very distinguished Burmese officer.</p>

<p>It was natural that for some time after the
occupation there should be much confusion. But at
the very outset means might have been taken for
the preservation of the State Records; instead of
which, in the time-honoured phrase, soldiers were
allowed to play havoc with these documents; many
of them were burnt, many more were torn and
spoilt. The loss was irreparable. Immediately after
the Chief Commissioner’s arrival further destruction
was stopped, and the surviving records were collected
and deposited in the Council Chamber.
Much of interest was thus preserved, but many
State papers of priceless value, historically and
administratively, were irretrievably lost.</p>

<p>The Burmese of Mandalay did not in the least
recognize that they had been conquered. They
were as free and easy and unconcerned and bumptious
as if the King was still seated on the throne.
The first task set me in Mandalay, the day after our
arrival, was to find a Mohammedan doctor who was
believed to have arrived lately from Bhamo. This
was literally all the direction or clue given to aid
me in a search among nearly 200,000 strange people.
Not even the man’s name was known. Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Sladen kindly placed at my disposal a small Burmese
official, and as we rode out of the South Gate
my companion was hailed by a friend and asked
where he was going with the young barbarian (kala).
My Burmese was fluent and vigorous. However,
though I liked not the manners of his friend, my
man was an intelligent, willing fellow, and before
the winter sun had set we found and brought back
the object of our mission. Later on, when much
distress had been caused by fires, incendiary and
accidental, the Burmans of Mandalay grew rather
sulky. But nothing cured them of their <i>insouciance</i>.
When fires were destroying their dwellings, they
looked on quite calmly without offering to lend a
hand, while British officers took extreme risks to
save life and property in burning houses.</p>

<p>“There is a very valuable box in that house” (in
a blaze). “Would you mind bringing it out for
me?” I heard a Burman say to a British officer, who
complied with the cool request.</p>

<p>At this time we were almost completely cut off
from Lower Burma and Rangoon. The telegraph
line was interrupted, while letters came slowly by
steamer once a week. Postal arrangements were
necessarily of a primitive kind. The post-office was
a flat, or barge, high and dry on the river-bank.
When a steamer came from Rangoon, the mail-bags
were opened and their contents cast on the deck of
the flat. We who had hastened down on hearing of
the steamer’s approach were allowed, even invited,
to search the pile and take what belonged to us.
In spite of this apparently hazardous procedure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
I heard of no letters going astray. I quarrelled
quite seriously with a high officer of the post-office
because I said in his hearing, incautiously and,
I confess, unjustly, that I was sending letters to
Rangoon by messenger rather than trust them to
the post. For some months, if not years, we were
unfriends; but I am glad to say that, in the course
of time, we were reconciled.</p>

<p>I was soon taken from Secretariat work and sent
as civil officer with a column. A detachment of
Madras Cavalry without support had been sent to
repair the telegraph line between Ava and Myingyan.
They had met with resistance and been forced to return.
The task was then entrusted to an adequate
force. Two guns, British infantry, Madras Cavalry,
and Madras Pioneers were placed under the command
of Major Fenwick, I.S.C. Captain R. A. P.
Clements<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> was staff officer; Mr. H. d’U. Keary<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
and Mr. Rainey<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> were of our party. At Ava, where
we halted before starting on our march, Maung
Hlwa, the local Wun, came in and made his submission,
among the first-fruits of Burmese loyalty in
that part of the country. Maung Hlwa, I am glad
to say, still survives and draws his pension. He
was an official of the good old Upper Burman type.
Not over-educated, without very delicate scruples,
of proved courage, with boundless personal influence
(awza), wherever he was sent he was a loyal and
useful servant of Government. No better man than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
he to bring a troublesome township into order. He
was one of the Burmese officers who went to the
Coronation Durbar at Delhi in 1903, where he was
deeply impressed by the pomp and splendour of the
occasion. On this march he was of the utmost
service, though I am not quite sure that he did not
take advantage of the opportunity to pay off some
old scores. So quiet seemed the country and so
little did we expect attack that I used to ride for
miles along the river-bank and through the jungle
at Ava with no other companion but Maung Hlwa.
Yet within a month, at Sagaing on the opposite
bank, four officers were attacked within sight of the
Government steamer <i>Irrawaddy</i>, and three of their
number slain by dacoits who issued from ambush,
cut down their victims, and disappeared before the
rest of the party, walking not a couple of hundred
yards behind, were aware of what had happened.
The fall of Mandalay had been so sudden that it
had not yet been realized in rural places, and the
forces of opposition had not yet been organized.
Very soon the turmoil began. It was then long
before officers were able to travel without escort in
Upper Burma.</p>

<p>This was one of the first daurs, or small expeditions,
undertaken. Keeping close to the telegraph
line which it was our primary duty to restore to
working order, we marched through the midst of
the Ava subdivision. In fine open country we rode
daily over sessamum fields or through tall growths
of millet, making our first acquaintance with the
land where so much of our lives was to be spent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
The climate was cool and pleasant, so that we were
able to march far into the morning. At the village
where the cavalry had been routed we were so
hospitably received that, to the best of my recollection,
no punishment for past misdeeds was inflicted.
We were particularly touched to find here two
Madrasi sayces,<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> cavalry followers who had been
missing since the engagement, and who had, in fact,
been wounded and disabled. They had been
plastered and nursed by the villagers, and were
restored to us none the worse for their adventure.
Not much farther on we found a crucified man falling
to pieces after long exposure to sun and wind.
I believe it was customary to kill the victim
before affixing his body to a St. Andrew’s cross. In
early days, after a successful skirmish with dacoits,
a Burman assistant approached the civil officer,
saying as a matter of course: “I suppose it is time
now to crucify the prisoners!” Incidents like these
illustrate the charming inconsistency of the Burmese
character already noted.</p>

<p>Later on in our march we were resisted at two
villages and had two little fights without, I think,
any casualties on our side. After all the people had
been cleared out, the first village was burnt for
reasons of military necessity. Rightly enough, the
burning of villages has always been discouraged,
indeed, strictly forbidden, save as an extreme
measure or for military reasons. But, when occasion
arises, it is very interesting to put a match to a
thatched roof and see it blaze to the sky. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
second village had to be shelled. Clements and I,
who had ridden round to examine one of the farther
approaches, found ourselves in the unpleasant position
of being shelled by our own side. There I saw
an instance of the stoical resolution with which
Burmans meet death. A man torn to pieces by a
shell asked only for an umbrella to shield him from
the sun and a cheroot to smoke while he awaited
the end. Both were supplied while our surgeon
afforded such relief as might be. Here is another
inconsistency. By a shout and the explosion of a
cracker, a band of dacoits<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> will put to flight all the
men of a village, who stampede, leaving the women
and children at the mercy of the assailants. Dacoits
themselves go to work with trembling knees and
hearts of water, ready to fly at the first sign of
resistance. Yet men of the same race and class face
a firing party with a smile or walk to the gallows
with unfaltering step. Once, at a military execution,
some half a dozen dacoits were put up, one by one,
against the city wall to be shot. The first man had
the top of his head blown off by the volley. His
companions awaiting their turn burst into a laugh
at his grotesque appearance.</p>

<p>A day or two after Christmas we halted at My̆otha
in the middle of the Ava subdivision and there held
the first gymkhana in the jungle of Upper Burma.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Pony races and other sporting events for officers and
men and for local Burmans made up the programme.
It was a characteristic episode. The people of
My̆otha were very friendly and joined with enthusiasm
in the proceedings. Here I confirmed in
his office the My̆othugyi.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> I am told that he still
holds the appointment. After leaving My̆otha, we
had our third and last encounter with dacoits.
Captain Clements and Mr. Rainey took a few
sowárs<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> to escort a telegraph working-party a few
miles from our camp. So unexciting seemed the
prospect that the rest of us stayed behind. Some
of us walked unattended to a neighbouring village
and sat for a long time talking with the headman
and his people. The working-party and the escort
were met by a hostile line of Burmans armed with
muskets. Followed by the sowárs, the officers
charged and routed the enemy, but Clements fell
with two holes in his chest. No wonder the
surgeon looked grave. A bullet in each lung, God
shield us, is a most dreadful thing. However, a
fortnight afterwards I found Clements quite active
at mess at Tha-yet-my̆o. I infer that his pony
swerved at the volley and that the two holes were
made by the same bullet. In Burma Clements got
another wound and two brevets. He served with
great distinction in South Africa, and after passing
through many campaigns was cut off by appendicitis
at Quetta in the midst of a brilliant career.
A fine officer, a perfect horseman, with a frame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
of iron, even in youth he gave promise of future
eminence.</p>

<p>Another unfortunate incident was an outbreak of
cholera in our camp, which brought us to a halt for
some days and cost valuable lives. A stalwart
young sergeant of gunners was specially regretted.
A halt on account of cholera is one of the most
gloomy and depressing experiences, particularly for
the men. It was with somewhat chastened feelings
that we marched into Myingyan. Our one consolation
was that we had accomplished our purpose and
reopened telegraphic communication with Rangoon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Kinwun Mingyi, who had gone
with the ex-King, had returned to Mandalay, and
the Taingda Mingyi, the evil genius of the dynasty,
had been sent to Hazaribagh. Mr. Bernard was
convinced of the Taingda Mingyi’s active disloyalty.
It was notorious that, in the King’s time, he
fomented disorder and shared the spoils of dacoity.
There were reasonable grounds for believing that he
continued these practices and that his power was
exerted against the Government. To retain this
man in a leading position on Colonel Sladen’s Council,
or even to allow him to stay in Burma, deprived of
office, in a private station, was fraught with grave
risk. In Mandalay his influence was supreme. His
speedy removal without previous warning seemed
clearly desirable. This was dramatically effected.
As the Mingyi sat in the midst of the Hlutdaw,
Mr. Pilcher entered and summoned him to the
Chief Commissioner’s presence. Arriving there, he
was told that he was to be sent to India. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
request for permission to go to his house before
leaving was refused. Seated with Mr. Pilcher in a
bullock-carriage, he was driven to the shore. As he
passed out of the West, the Traitors’, Gate, there
was a block, and the carriage halted. “Is this where
you are going to kill me?” asked the old man.
Under the provisions of the beneficent Regulation
III. of 1818, the Mingyi was detained for
several years. Long after the country had been at
peace, he was allowed to return and end his days in
Burma in receipt of an allowance from Government.
He was a man of much force of character, comparatively
uneducated, and, unless his face and
common fame belied him, of harsh and cruel nature.
That protruding under-lip and that glance, stern
even in old age, were signs of a fiery and turbulent
soul. After his return he did no harm, and, having
lost his wealth in foolish speculations, he died a poor
man. I helped to get a small pension for his widow,
an innocent old lady, who was, I believe, sincerely
grateful. The pension was granted as an act of
grace, not out of respect for the Mingyi’s memory.</p>

<p>About this time I went on one more little daur,
perhaps hardly worth mentioning. Dacoits were
entrenched in the Kaung-hmu-daw Pagoda, not very
far from Sagaing. A column, with Colonel Lowndes
as civil officer, was sent against them. Another
column, which I accompanied, started at the same
time and went up the river. We were to hold a
defile in the hills and cut off the retreat of the
dacoits dislodged from Kaung-hmu-daw. The arrival
of the main body at Sagaing was marked by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
the lamentable incident already narrated.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Next
morning, as arranged, the pagoda was attacked and
the defenders driven out. The rest of the plan miscarried.
Our intelligence was grievously at fault.
The only pass in the hills, we found, ran from east to
west. Through it we marched at the mercy of any
hostile force which might be crowning the heights.
Emerging scathless from this gorge, as no one took
advantage of so fair a chance, we reached a wide
champaign over which an army corps might have
scattered without coming near us. That Sunday
morning we had a pleasant picnic on a breezy down,
and towards nightfall we marched back, having seen
no one worse than ourselves.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
LORD DUFFERIN’S VISIT: MANDALAY ONCE MORE</h2>

<p>Early in 1886 Mr. Bernard returned to Rangoon.
As I was not in Lower Burma for any length of
time from December, 1885, to March, 1887, it does
not fall within the scope of this book to attempt a
description of events in that part of the Province in
the months following the occupation of Mandalay.
It was a time of stress and anxiety. Insurrections,
excited no doubt by emissaries from the Burmese
Court and headed in more than one case by monks,
broke out all over the country. For a time Lower
Burma was a seething mass of disorder. With
inadequate military and police forces, Commissioners
and district officers bravely faced the situation, and
by strenuous efforts suppressed rebellion and gradually
restored peace. In the early months, in the
Chief Commissioner’s absence from Rangoon, the
general direction of operations was in the hands of
Mr. Symes, then an officer of ten years’ service.
With what nerve, resolution, and judgment he discharged
this great responsibility only those who
served in Lower Burma at that time can properly
appreciate. No one could have done better and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
more valuable work in a very serious crisis. Those
early months showed Mr. Symes to be an administrator
of the highest class, and won for him the
reputation which he enjoyed to the day of his
lamented death.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1886 Lord Dufferin came to
study on the spot the problem of Upper Burma and
practically to decide its destiny. At the same time
came Sir Frederick Roberts, then Commander-in-Chief
in India. With the Viceroy were Mr. Durand,<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
Foreign Secretary; Mr. Mackenzie,<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Home Secretary;
Mr. Mackenzie Wallace,<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Private Secretary;
and Lord William Beresford, Military Secretary, a
galaxy of talent. Lord Clandeboye, afterwards Earl
of Ava, in the flower of his youth and beauty, was
among the aides-de-camp. Sir Frederick Roberts’s
staff was hardly less brilliant. It included Major
W. G. Nicholson,<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Major Ian Hamilton,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Captain
Neville Chamberlain,<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> and Colonel Pole-Carew.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
Besides being the best-known man of his time in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
India, Beresford was probably the best Military
Secretary in history. He was thoroughly conversant
with every detail of his office. Equally at
home in the direction of a Durbar or the management
of a social gathering, with singular charm of
manner, he had the delightful gift of being all things
to all men. At a garden party he might be seen in
close converse with a pillar of the Church, or hanging
on the lips of an American Missionary, as if this
idyllic communion was the one thing for which he
lived. After this visit, the Bishop of Rangoon confided
his opinion to a friend: “I am glad to see that
the tone of the Viceregal Court is so good. Do
you know? I think this high standard is in a great
measure due to the influence of Beresford.” In
Rangoon the usual festivities were held. At a ball
I was deputed to interpret between His Excellency
and Burmese ladies and gentlemen. Lord Dufferin’s
embroidered compliments, addressed to some fair
ladies, severely taxed my homespun vernacular.</p>

<p>After a short stay in Rangoon Lord Dufferin and
Sir Frederick Roberts went up to Mandalay in the
steamer <i>Mindoon</i>, fitted out and placed at the Viceroy’s
disposal by the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company.
Stopping at various places on the way, the Viceroy
made the acquaintance of the local military and
civil officers. The visit to Mandalay was an unqualified
success. Their Excellencies, for Lady
Dufferin lent her gracious presence to the occasion,
were welcomed by the military and civil officers
and all the Burmese notables. They were installed
in the finest rooms in the Palace, visited all scenes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
of interest in the town and city, and received the
members of the royal house and the most eminent
Burmese officers and their families. On the eastern
terrace of the Palace the Viceroy held a levée, the
first and only instance of that ceremony being held
in the Nandaw.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Just before his departure, in a
mandat<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> erected on the shore, he addressed a meeting
of Burmese Ministers and high officials. His
speech was interpreted by an Extra Assistant
Commissioner, Maung Pyi. Failing to catch one
sentence, the interpreter vainly tried to induce his
Excellency to repeat it. Nothing daunted, Maung
Pyi, with perfect assurance, evolved and uttered an
elaborate sentence of his own. The incident passed
unnoticed. Lord Dufferin’s name will always be
associated with Upper Burma. From Ava he took
one of his titles, and he acceded to the request that
the cantonment of Mandalay, embracing the city
as well as an area without the walls, should bear his
name.</p>

<p>On the voyage and after his arrival in Mandalay
the Viceroy and his advisers conferred with Mr.
Bernard concerning the future of the newly acquired
dominion. With the sanction of the Secretary of
State, his Excellency, at a dinner given on the eve
of his departure, announced the decision that the
country was to be administered as part of British
India. It was on this occasion, and by Mr. Bernard,
that the familiar term “annexation” was first publicly
used. Then, having accomplished the purpose
of his visit, the Viceroy re-embarked for Prome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
Just opposite Pagan, whereat the state of the district
did not invite a landing, the <i>Mindoon</i> stuck
fast on a sandbank for nearly twelve hours, a really
characteristic incident on the Irrawaddy. Lord
Dufferin was not in the least disconcerted or annoyed;
he professed to be pleased to have one day’s
entire rest. Towards evening the whole party were
on the point of being transferred to some small craft
in attendance, but luckily the steamer floated off
in time, and this inconvenience was avoided. The
return to Rangoon was saddened by the tidings of
the death of Mr. H. L. St. Barbe, one of the most
rising men in the Province, whose very remarkable
personality gave every promise of distinction.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> He
was killed in the Bassein District, one of the first
victims of the dacoit bands which harassed Lower
Burma for three or four years.</p>

<p>By their charm and courtesy Lord and Lady
Dufferin won all hearts, and left the happiest impression
on the people of the Province. Still a
junior officer, naturally I was not brought into close
or frequent contact with them; but on the voyage
to and from Mandalay I was near enough to come
under the spell. Lord Dufferin was no doubt an
admirable Viceroy. His dignity and presence, as
well as his brilliant gifts, were specially fitted to
adorn that illustrious office. He did not condescend
to detail or profess to be industrious in small things.
Industry, it has been said, is the tribute which
mediocrity pays to genius. Often, I have heard, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
was difficult to induce him to attend to matters of
routine. But a really important case inspired him
with enthusiasm, and on it he shed the rays of an
illuminating mind; to its polished completion he
devoted infinite pains. His visit in the early years
of his Viceroyalty was greatly to the benefit of the
Province. During the rest of his life in India his
warm and friendly interest in Burma never failed.</p>

<p>The annexation of Upper Burma has been
criticized not only by those who regard with disapproval
every extension of the Empire. A very
distinguished officer, whose best years had been
passed in Burma, and who was familiar with both
parts of the Province, suggested to me as one grave
objection that the annexation extinguished a nationality,
a thing which had not before been done in
India. I have no doubt that, especially from the
point of view of the good of the Burmese race, the
annexation was an unmixed advantage. So far from
extinguishing a nationality, we reintegrated it. Up
to 1885 Burma was in a state of disunion. Part
flourished under British rule; part languished under
native tyranny. Some Burmans were British subjects;
some served their own King. The conquest
of Upper Burma reunited the severed fragments.
Once more Burma became a solid country, the
Burmese a nation under one undivided control;
and as such it began a career of almost unexampled
prosperity. Although there are differences and distinctions
between the two sections, due to the varied
course of their past history, Burma now forms one
Province, and every part shares in the fortunes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the whole. The annexation did far more than this.
It restored peace and order to a distracted people,
and secured to every man the free enjoyment of the
fruits of his labours. To all men were given the
protection of equal laws and the assurance of even-handed
justice. The grasping avarice of officials was
restrained, and corrupt practices were discountenanced.
Burmans are not excluded from a due share
in the administration. To aspiring youths, promising
careers have been thrown open. The second Burman
as yet enlisted in the higher branch of the Accounts
Department is an Upper Burman, the first to take
the degree of Bachelor of Arts. On those Burmans
who loyally accepted the new Government, office and
honours were freely bestowed. The Kinwun Mingyi
became a Companion of the Star of India, U Pe Si
of the Indian Empire. The real patriots were those
who recognized that the new order meant peace and
prosperity, with no suppression of native religion or
customs, and who risked obloquy, and often life and
property, in loyal service to the State. These were
truer friends of their people than men who, by
ineffectual revolt and resistance, plunged their
country for years into bloodshed and misery.</p>

<p>In March, 1886, Sir Charles Bernard returned to
Mandalay. On April 1 the provisional administration
of the Hlutdaw came to an end. Sir Edward
Sladen retired, and the Chief Commissioner assumed
direct control of Upper Burma. At the same time
the Burma Field Force was broken up, Sir Harry
Prendergast returned to India, and Sir George
White took command of the troops. While retaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
general control of the whole Province, Sir Charles
Bernard left Lower Burma under the immediate
direction of Mr. G. J. S. Hodgkinson<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> as Special
Commissioner, devoting his own energies mainly to
the settlement of the new Province and the modelling
of its administration. An entirely separate
Secretariat was formed, of which, as Secretary for
Upper Burma, I was in sole charge. My office was
in the Hlutdaw building, within the Palace enclosure.
We had our own little printing-press,
modestly but efficiently equipped by Mr. Regan,
and we published our own <i>Gazette</i>. My only qualified
assistant was Mr. Taw Sein Ko,<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> then in his
early youth, to whom I am indebted for invaluable
assistance during those busy months as well as in
later years. Of the clerical staff, the less said the
better. It was, perhaps, a unique Secretariat, with
no records of previous years and no precedents.
Whatever the Secretary might forget, the Chief
Commissioner remembered. Besides myself, the only
member of Sir Charles Bernard’s immediate staff
was the Personal Assistant. This office was filled
first by Andrew Thomson, C.S., a man of brilliant
ability and exceptional gifts. Later came Sir Charles
Bernard’s elder son, J. H. Bernard, C.S., endowed
with many of the qualities of his family. Andrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Thomson died in the flower of his youth, <i>multis bonis
flebilis</i>. James Bernard died in Bengal, in tragic
circumstances, midway in a career of promise. Never
were two pleasanter or more helpful comrades.</p>

<p>
Though the Hlutdaw was dissolved, seven or eight
of the principal Ministers were retained on moderate
salaries as a consultative body. They had their own
office in the Hlutdaw building, with a few clerks,
and were in charge of the old State records. The
handwriting of these clerks was most elaborate and
beautiful. Such writing is now, I fear, a lost art.
In the King’s time Court writers were kept up to
the mark by fear of heavy penalties. For wrongly
dividing a word at the end of a line (like thi-<br />
s) the punishment was amputation of the right hand.
It seems almost excessive. The Sayedawgyi were
of a higher class than ordinary clerks in Government
offices. Some of them were related to Ministers, or
even to members of the royal family. And often
enough they blossomed into Wuns or Ministers.
Among them were men of ability and character. I
instance my friend Maung Tin, A.T.M., Extra
Assistant Commissioner, long resident at Pagan as
township officer, now subdivisional officer, a recognized
authority on the antiquities of that historic
city. Another, also Maung Tin, A.T.M., Extra
Assistant Commissioner and subdivisional officer,
has written a learned history of Burma. Both are
men of good family and have attained responsible
positions under our Government. The Ministers
had no powers, but were often consulted on matters
of which they had special knowledge or means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
information. Punctually at noon every day, a
chaprási<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> came into my office and announced the
Minister’s approach.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> At the ensuing conference
public affairs were discussed and the opinions of
Ministers invited. If the stock of references was
low, the conversation turned to Burmese history and
family affairs, of which their knowledge was extensive
and accurate. One day we were all bidden to
the wedding of the late Shwepyi Mingyi’s daughter.
A peculiar custom prevailed among the wealthier
classes of having marriages celebrated by Pônnas,
Hindu descendants of captives from Assam or
Manipúr. It has already been explained that Buddhism,
as understood in Burma, provides no ceremony
of marriage. The custom of inviting Pônnas to
celebrate marriages of Buddhists with some sort of
Hindu rite, the binding with a thread and the
eating out of the same dish, is a curious anomaly for
which I can find no parallel. This was a wedding
of the Pônna type. All Mandalay attended, including
many European officers. To complete the
quaint mixture of foreign ceremonies, the health of
bride and bridegroom was drunk in champagne by
those of the company who allowed themselves that
indulgence. Late in the morning, as I was about
to leave, one of the Ministers said with a sigh:
“Well, I suppose we must be getting away to office
too.” The suggestion that such a festal day might
be spent as a holiday was accepted with effusion.
There was something pathetic in the thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
these men, all of mature and some of advanced years,
who had exercised almost absolute sway over a
kingdom, regarding themselves as under the orders
of an officer so much their junior in age. I did my
best to make the position as little irksome as might
be. As I retained the friendship of every one of
them as long as he lived, I hope my efforts had some
measure of success.
</p>

<p>With the Kinwun Mingyi I contracted a close and
intimate friendship, which ended only with his death
at an advanced age. In early days Andrew Thomson
and I were often at his house, playing with his
charming grandchildren, small boys and girls of four
or five years of age; sometimes on Sunday mornings
we went to his garden beyond the walls for an early
picnic. The Mingyi was a man of amiable disposition
and courtly manners, of great learning, a
delightful companion. To have had the privilege
of discussing with him the doctrine of Neikban
(Nirvana) is a pleasant memory. Although he could
have no real love for our Government, he loyally
accepted it, and did his best to support and
strengthen the new order. I believe him to have
been a man of high character, incapable of any base
or treacherous act. His personal record was unimpeachable;
he lived and died in honourable
disregard of wealth. He had no children except
two sons by adoption.</p>

<p>Another house where I was always welcome was
that of the widow of the Pagan Min. She was his
principal Queen, and occupied the house where the
deposed King and herself had lived since the acces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>sion
of Mindôn Min.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> It was interesting to meet in
such conditions one who had sat on the throne and
was sprung from the race of Burma’s Kings. She
was a charming lady, advanced in years, with the
fine manners of her rank and people. In the house
of the Pintha Mintha<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> I was also received on cordial
terms. My friendship with his family subsists to
this day.</p>

<p>The description already given<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> of the position of
women in Burma may help to render intelligible the
sketch of our life in Mandalay in early days. For
some months European ladies were not encouraged
to come to Mandalay. Most of us were extremely
busy, and lived an austere life in the Palace. For
companionship we were dependent on one another
and on our Burmese friends. The people of whom
I saw most in rare intervals of relaxation were
officials and their families and members of the royal
house. Queens and Princesses were many. For a
melancholy reason Princes were few. Except the
Myingun Prince in Pondicherry, and the Nyaung-yan
and Nyaung-ôk Princes in Calcutta, only two
of Mindôn Min’s sons survived&mdash;the Kawlin and
Pyinmana<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Princes.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Educated in India, these two
have now for some years lived in charming domesticity
in Rangoon; each happily married to a lady of
his House. Both are honorary magistrates, and duly
take their turn as members of a Bench for the trial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
of petty cases. There were a few other Minthas,
sons of the Einshemin<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> and other Princes, besides
more distant relations of the King. Several of the
Minthas have taken service under Government, and
occupy responsible positions as Assistant Commissioners,
My̆o-ôks, and in other departments. Almost
all the ladies of the Royal House, widows and
daughters of Mindôn Min, or otherwise nearly related
to the King, were in great distress and
poverty. For the most part they had subsisted on
meagre allowances, many of them being kept in
confinement or under restraint. All these ladies
received pensions from the British Government, but
on so minute a scale that Sir Charles Bernard’s
proposals for their maintenance excited by their
moderation the surprise even of the Government of
India. Yet when income-tax was, as some think
illegally, levied in Upper Burma on incomes derived
from Government, I am ashamed to say that these
paltry stipends were subjected to deduction. From
time to time the scale of pensions was raised, but it
was not till many years later that I had the good
fortune to enlist Lord Minto’s active sympathy with
these ladies, and to secure for them allowances not
utterly inadequate. Most prominent of the royal
ladies in Mandalay were two full sisters of King
Thebaw, the Pakangyi and Meiktila Supaya.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
Meiktila Supaya married a commoner, and died some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
years ago, leaving two charming daughters, of whom
one is the wife of a Government officer. The Amá-daw-gyi<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
brought up her nieces, and lived quietly
in Mandalay till recent days. Only one of Mindôn
Min’s wives of royal stock survived till our time.
Wives of inferior rank were not of royal blood, but
for the most part daughters of officials or chiefs.
The three whom I knew best were three sisters, the
Limban, Thetpan, and Thayazein Queens, daughters
of a Talaing My̆o-thugyi in Lower Burma. They
were ladies of dignity and refinement, with whom
my family and I were long on terms of intimacy.
Only the Thayazein Queen survives, living happily
with her daughters and grandchildren in Rangoon.
The pension list included over one hundred persons.
At first the Princesses shrank from marrying commoners,
but clearly most of them must condescend
or remain unwed. Many of them, therefore, in the
course of time took husbands of inferior rank. In
the quarter of a century which has passed since the
annexation, not one of the ladies of the Burmese
royal family has given the slightest trouble to
Government from a political point of view; none
of them has intrigued or shared in any conspiracy
or seditious movement. When the prominent part
taken by Burmese women in public and private
affairs is remembered, it will be admitted that, if
for this reason alone, these ladies merit gentle
treatment at our hands. I think they might at
least be excused from paying income-tax on their
pensions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be appropriate here to notice the theory
and practice of class distinctions in Burma. The
King and the royal family were placed on a lone
and lofty pedestal, and regarded with exaggerated
reverence. In respect of royalty there was almost,
not quite, a distinction of caste. An instance of
respect for the sacredness of the blood royal came
under my own notice. A granddaughter of Mindôn
Min, daughter of his son by a minor Queen, a
charming and attractive girl, eloped with the
Queen’s nephew, a very presentable youth. The
boy was one of the Queen’s household, son of the
Queen’s own brother, a commoner. The Mipaya’s<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
distress and indignation were extreme. To console
her, I suggested that, after all, the lover was of her
own family. “I would as soon she had married a
coolie out of the street,” was the uncompromising
reply. The old lady had no rest till she had worried
these young people to divorce, and married the girl
to a Princeling. Anomalies were necessarily recognized.
Though the King took as his chief Queen
one of his half-sisters, Kings and Princes might
marry commoners; royal ladies might not do so.
Of late, as we have seen, this rule has become less
strict. But genuine respect for the royal family
still abounds. To this day, whether in Upper or
Lower Burma, any upstart who pretends to royal
origin secures a following.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> The very sensible plan
of employing them as My̆o-ôks and Extra Assistant
Commissioners has done much to keep real sons of
Princes out of mischief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>Apart from the royal family and monks, the only
distinct class among Burmans is that of officials.
There is no landed gentry; there are no county
families. In most cases, especially in the higher
grades, official rank was not hereditary. The
Mingyi’s son did not become a Mingyi, or the
Wun’s son a Wun, by succession. Occasionally one
came across officers, like my friend U Pe Si,<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
sprung from official families. This was the result
of nepotism, not heredity. As a rule an official
obtained his position by luck or by favour or by
family influence, by repute for learning, or by distinction
as a soldier or administrator. The royal
family and officials excluded, the rest of the people
were on the same social plane. False pride and
snobbishness were unknown. One of the Ministers,
of eminent learning, who came clad in silks and
glittering with golden chains, brought his brother
to see me. The brother was an old peasant out of
the fields, who sat on the floor, wearing the scanty
dress of the working farmer. We had a pleasant
talk about crops and seasons, while the Minister sat
on a chair and discussed what Prince Hassan<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> used
to call “country business.” It is, perhaps, to this
absence of false pride, to genuine kindness of heart,
and to traditional respect for elders, that the fine
manners of Burmans are due. Good manners and
self-respect are marks of all ranks. I have received
perfect civility and courtesy from Princes and
Ministers, from peasants and labouring men; always
a kind word and a smile and thought for a guest’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
comfort and convenience. Even contact with
Western civilization has not yet spoilt the grace of
manner which adorns the Burmese race.</p>

<p>The lack of class distinctions imports a certain
want of cohesion, which does not facilitate the task
of administration. Burmans are rank individualists,
and so, I suppose, far behind the times. Each
family is a separate entity, bound by no ties to any
overlord. It is true that the hereditary principle is
strong in the case of minor offices, such as those of
My̆o-thugyi<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> or Ywa-thugyi.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> These comparatively
small but important offices passed from father to
son for generations. In Lower Burma we have
practically abolished the circle, and in Upper Burma
the My̆o is likewise in process of decay. I for one
agree that the village is the better unit. Yet some
tribute of respect must be paid to the old My̆o-thugyi,
a courtly country gentleman of dignity and presence,
possibly more ornamental than useful.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
THE FIRST YEAR AFTER THE ANNEXATION</h2>

<p>The task of constituting the new Administration
and of reducing the country to order was rendered
especially difficult by the rigid economy at first
contemplated by the Government of India. In the
discussions during the Viceroy’s visit it is understood
that frugality was declared essential. With
the loyalty which in him, as in Sir Arthur Phayre,
rose almost to a passion, Sir Charles Bernard did
his utmost to carry out the wishes of Government.
Beyond doubt or dispute, a burden far greater than
any man should be asked to bear was placed upon
the Chief Commissioner’s shoulders. Yet the Titan
never showed signs of weariness. There were to be
no Divisional Commissioners; district officers were
to work under the Chief Commissioner’s orders.
The provision for police, especially military police,
was quite inadequate. The Secretariat staff was
plainly insufficient. No one but Sir Charles Bernard,
with his immense power of work, his loyal enthusiasm,
his marvellous memory and mastery of detail, could
have attempted the task. And the effort was beyond
even those exceptional powers. In the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
year of the occupation Sir Charles Bernard, for
some time single-handed, organized and directed the
administration of the new Province, doing the work
of three ordinary men, dealing as far as possible
immediately in police matters with the Inspector-General,
in forest matters with the Conservator,
keeping close touch and on the most friendly terms
with the military authorities, keeping also in personal
contact with every district officer, guiding,
encouraging, seldom admonishing. Throughout this
year of labour and anxiety he was hardly a week
free from severe and painful illness. Almost from
the beginning he was the target of malicious and
venomous attack. With an inadequate though loyal
and efficient staff in the districts; with scanty funds
doled out by the Imperial Government, which then,
as ever, treated Burma with unsympathetic parsimony;
under the depressing effects of illness, the
object of ignorant and unscrupulous detraction, the
work done by Sir Charles Bernard in that first year,
when order began to be evolved out of chaos, has
never been properly appreciated in public. But no
civil officer who served in Upper Burma in that
year fails to recognize the heroic work done by his
Chief, or to remember the support and encouragement
received from him in times of trouble, doubt,
and confusion. No military officer of standing forgets
the loyal co-operation of the civil power as represented
by the Chief Commissioner. Sir Charles
Bernard could not remain in Burma to complete his
work. He laid a sound basis for the restoration of
order and the building up of the fabric of settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
government. The report of the year’s work issued
at the end of 1886 was a record of which no
Administration need have been ashamed.</p>

<p>As might have been foreseen from the first, it
was soon found impossible for the Chief Commissioner
directly to control the affairs of every District.
Upper Burma was therefore partitioned into Divisions,
and Commissioners were appointed. In June,
Mr. H. St. G. Tucker, C.S., became Commissioner of
the Eastern Division, with headquarters at Ningyan
(Pyinmana). This division was more remote from
Mandalay than any part of the Province as yet
sought to be administered; there was no communication
with it by water, and neither road nor rail
was yet in being. In August and September three
other divisions were constituted. Mr. G. D. Burgess,
C.S., became Commissioner of the Northern Division;
Mr. F. W. R. Fryer,<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> C.S., with a great reputation
from the Punjab, assumed charge of the Central
Division, both for a time residing at Mandalay;
Mr. J. J. Digges La Touche,<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> C.S., from the North-West
Provinces, was posted to the Southern Division,
with headquarters at Minbu. With some adjustment
of local limits, these Divisions still subsist.
Their names have been changed, not, I think, for
the better, and in most cases the headquarters
have been shifted. The appointment of these officers
afforded the Chief Commissioner appreciable relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>Having taken over an area twice as large as
Lower Burma, Sir Charles Bernard was confronted
with the task of finding officers to administer it.
Obviously the existing staff could not be stretched
to cover the new Province and provide equipment
for the old Province as well. For the Commission
civilians were sent from other provinces, military
civilians were recruited, and appointments were
offered to men in various departments or not yet
in Government service. In each of these alternatives
there were advantages and disadvantages.
Civilians from other provinces, though versed in the
art of administration, were ignorant of the language
and customs of Burma. Military civilians, excellent
material, needed some training in civil work.
Officers of other departments and non-officials recruited
in the Province knew the language and the
people, but had no acquaintance with administrative
methods. The last-mentioned defect is probably
regarded by many as imaginary. While for other
arts and professions a laborious education is necessary,
we all know that government and administration
are gifts of the gods and come by nature. We
are all familiar with brilliant amateurs in administration,
who know their work far better than those
trained to the business from their youth. The
Commission was thus a composite body, probably
not so supremely excellent as that which undertook
the settlement of the Punjab under John and Henry
Lawrence, but full of ability and zeal. The Civil
Service, the Army, and what were then called the
Uncovenanted Services, furnished officers of con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>spicuous
merit, who in the years immediately
succeeding the annexation and in later times did
invaluable work. Without making invidious distinctions
or offering presumptuous criticisms, I may
mention of the early new-comers Mr. H. P. Todd-Naylor,<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
Mr. J. George Scott,<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Mr. H. A. Browning,<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
Mr. B. S. Carey,<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> and Mr. H. M. S. Matthews.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>The officering of the civil police was one of even
greater difficulty, the pay and prospects being far
less attractive. Some officers were drafted from
other Provinces. Many adventurous young gentlemen
flocked to Mandalay, eager to take part in
the settlement of a new Province. Of these some
were appointed to be inspectors, some to be even
head constables, with a prospect of obtaining
gazetted rank in the course of time. Most of them
did excellent work, fully justifying their selection.
From time to time some were transferred to the
Commission. The majority had a hard and disappointing
life, waiting long for the realization of
their dreams. The story of the Burma Civil Police
is one of hope deferred, and of weary plodding
through many dismal years. It is greatly to the
credit of its officers that they did well under such
depressing conditions.</p>

<p>In the first year, at least, the bulk of the actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
work of pacification was done by the army of occupation.
Sir George White was in command, brave
among the brave, cheeriest of companions, loyalest
of friends, the warrior whom every man in arms
should wish to be. Chief of his Staff was Colonel
Prothero,<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> who worked all day and night without
turning a hair, whose gay serenity nothing could
ruffle, whose motto might have been:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Still to be neat, still to be dressed<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As always going to a feast.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the course of the summer, Sir Herbert Macpherson,
V.C.,<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> came over to exercise general control.
After his lamented death, the Commander-in-Chief
in India himself, Sir Frederick Roberts, spent some
months in Burma, occupying the summer-house in
the Palace garden where the King surrendered,
giving to civil and military administration the support
of his authority, the strength of his wise counsel.
Gradually, as the area of settled government
extended, the country was covered with a network
of small military posts, more than a hundred being
in existence at the end of the year.</p>

<p>In these months came the first two military police
battalions, raised by Mr. Loch and Mr. Gastrell.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
The Mandalay battalion, which I knew best, attracted
the flower of the Punjab. Under Mr. Gastrell’s
excellent command it became a thoroughly efficient
force, conspicuous among the large body of military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
police which garrisoned the country in subsequent
years. These military police played an important
part in the pacification. Their behaviour was most
praiseworthy. Several battalions later on were
converted into regular regiments of the Indian Army,
called at first Burma Regiments.</p>

<p>For civil administration the Province was parcelled
out into Districts, at first twelve, afterwards seventeen
in number, each in charge of a Deputy Commissioner,
with such Assistants as could be provided.
In some cases military commandants of outposts
were invested with civil powers, and did much useful
work in a civil capacity. Every effort was made to
enlist local Burman officials under Government, and
many became My̆o-ôks and rendered valuable service.
But it was impossible to induce higher officials to
leave Mandalay, and to take part in the settlement
of out-districts. The effort was made and failed.
One of Sir Charles Bernard’s first acts was the
preparation and promulgation of a set of instructions
to civil officers, an admirable compilation embracing
in a small compass all the rules necessary at the
outset for the guidance of his subordinates. That
was all the law we had in Upper Burma till the
end of November, 1886. As an instance of the care
taken to prevent hasty and harsh measures, it may
be mentioned that all capital sentences had to be
referred to the Chief Commissioner for confirmation.
When Commissioners were appointed, the duty of
confirming these sentences was delegated to them.</p>

<p>The chaos to which the country was reduced, and
the confusion which prevailed under the Burmese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Government, rendered the task of settlement extraordinarily
difficult. The country was overrun with
dacoit bands, ranging in numbers from five to five
hundred. The names of the leaders, Hla U, Bo<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
Cho, Bo Swè, Ôktama, Shwe Yan, became household
words. For some of the dacoit movements there was
no doubt a slight political move. A few scions of
the royal stock who had escaped the massacres of
1879 set up as pretenders to sovereignty, while here
and there men of humble origin assumed the style of
royalty and raised the standard of revolt. But as a
rule, from the deeds and aspirations of these robber
bands genuine patriotism was conspicuously absent.
Most of the gangs consisted of dacoits pure and
simple, whose sole object was plunder and rapine,
who held the countryside in terror, and committed
indescribable atrocities on their own people. Where-ever
there was an appearance of organized resistance,
Buddhist monks were among the chiefs. No political
movement of importance has been without a monk
as the leading spirit.</p>

<p>The story of the pacification has been told fully,
vividly, and accurately by Sir Charles Crosthwaite.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
It is not my purpose to attempt to tell the story
again. In the first year the work proceeded slowly,
but within limits effectually. Many dacoit leaders
were killed or captured, and the elements of regular
administration were introduced into several districts.
Revenue, of no enormous amount, it is true, was
collected; the country was covered with telegraph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
lines; useful public works were undertaken. The
early months were clouded by the loss in action of
Robert Phayre, a promising civilian;<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> the autumn
was saddened, for me most of all, by the death from
fever, in Kyauksè, of Robert Pilcher. A master of
their language, and sincerely in sympathy with them,
Pilcher was exceedingly popular with the Burmese.
The first time I ever saw a man literally beat his
breast for grief was when I told the good old
Taungtaya-ngasè Bo<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> the sad tidings of his death.
Since then I have seen men and boys beat their
breasts and shed real tears at the recital of the tale
of Hassan and Hussein<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> at the Mohurram. Pilcher
was a scholar with a touch of genius; his early
death was a loss to the State.</p>

<p class="caption smcap">A Burmese family.</p>
</div>

<p>Among the homely virtues of the Burmese must
be counted respect for parents. This is inculcated
in the Sacred Books, and forms a really pleasing
phase of family life. Two nephews of the Taung-gwin
Mingyi, one of the Council of Ministers, were
giving trouble in the Ava district. It was suggested
to the Mingyi that he should use his influence to
induce them to surrender and make peace with
Government. “Certainly,” said the Mingyi; “I
will send for their parents and put them in my
dungeon and afflict them till their sons come in.”
It was not possible to approve this crude proposal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
but the Mingyi was told that he might ask the
parents to stay with him, and talk kindly to them
about their erring children. The young men submitted
in a week, and gave no further trouble. In
Sagaing a famous Bo, Min O, was captured. His
life was forfeit for many crimes; but he was an old
man, and two of his sons were at large, leading
dacoit bands. Word was sent to them that if they
did not surrender, their father would be hanged; but
if they gave themselves up, his life would be spared.
Both came in. It will no doubt surprise some people
to learn that the promise to spare Min O’s life was
kept.</p>

<p>In the early days of April, 1886, there seemed to
be a lull in the storm. The time of the Burmese
New Year approached, always a time of some anxiety,
when, if ever, disturbance may be expected. Perhaps
this had not yet been realized. The exact moment
on which the New Year began was calculated by
the Pônnas,<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> who, besides officiating at weddings,
were also the royal astrologers.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> The time was to
be announced by the firing of a cannon from the
Palace enclosure. On that April morning the
astrologers assembled in the courtyard of the Palace.
The head seer drew a line in the dust, planted a
small stick, and declared that when the shadow of
the stick reached the line the auspicious moment
would have come. At the precise instant I made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
preconcerted sign, and the cannon was fired. It
might have been arranged as the signal of revolt
throughout the country. On that day all the
principal military posts in Upper Burma were
attacked, doubtless in pursuance of a definite plan.
Next morning my servant woke me rather early
with the intimation that “the enemy were at the
gate.” At dawn there had been a serious attack on
the city of Mandalay, swarming with troops, by a
band of some twenty or thirty rebels acting in concert
with a few confederates within the walls. Inside
the city two unlucky medical subordinates were
killed, and within and without incendiary fires were
lighted. The fire spread even to the Palace enclosure,
and we were in some anxiety for the main
buildings, which, once alight, would have burned like
matchwood. To the roof of the Hlutdaw mounted
the faithful Thwethaukgyi<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Tun Baw and his subordinates,
with chatties<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> of water and bamboo poles,
to quench and beat out flying sparks. Luckily the
fire in the enclosure was mastered, and we returned,
grimy and thirsty, relieved to find our quarters still
standing. As the Palace was crowded with military
and civil officers and their establishments, and contained
all the records, its destruction would have
been very inconvenient.</p>

<p>The fortnight which followed was the longest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
fortnight of my life. It was crowded with incident,
attacks and risings, above all, incendiary fires.
Since those days I have ceased to take interest in
fires. On the Queen’s Tower<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> stood a sentinel, day
and night, to sound the alarm. The easiest way to
the tower was through my bedroom. Nightly I
went to sleep in expectation of being aroused by the
fire-bugle and the tramp of men, and I was hardly
ever disappointed. Every night we climbed the
wooden tower, and saw the blaze of conflagration in
town or city. Once I asked the sentry if he had
heard any sound of firing. “Well, sir, I thought I
did hear one of them there brinjals,”<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> was the unexpected
answer. Once, again, fire broke out within
the Palace fence, but did not spread. This also was
well, as close to our quarters were considerable
quantities of gunpowder and dynamite. With the
early rains at the end of April fires ceased, and
Mandalay enjoyed comparative rest.</p>

<p>It was certain that some of the Burmese officials
in Mandalay were fomenting seditious movements in
the country. Suspicion fell upon the Shwehlan
Myowun<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> and the Hlethin Atwinwun.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> The Myowun
was removed to India in virtue of a warrant issued
under the invaluable Regulation III. of 1818. He
was taken from his house by Mr. J. G. Scott,<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> who
had joined the Commission and was on general
duty in Mandalay. Their next meeting was at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
pwè in Mandalay, on a memorable night in 1897,
long after the Myowun had been allowed to return.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
The Hlethin Atwinwun, most plausible and bland of
miscreants, believed to have been deeply involved
in the massacre of Princes, from whose hands one
expected to see blood still dripping, was moved to
visit Calcutta of his own accord in response to a
general invitation given to Burmese Ministers by
Lord Dufferin. He stayed in Calcutta for some
years, much against his will, but solely under pressure
of peaceful persuasion. He returned much
chastened, and lived on good terms with the officers
of Government till his death early last year.</p>

<p>In accordance with precedent not always observed,
King Mindôn had moved his capital from Amarapura
to Mandalay in the late fifties, transferring thither
many of the inhabitants and all the entourage of the
Court. The site was not in all respects well chosen.
Much of the town was below the level of the river
in high flood, and had to be protected by an embankment.
In the rains of 1886 the Irrawaddy rose
to an abnormal height, causing grave anxiety for
the safety of the bund.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> One night in August the
disaster came. The embankment was breached, and
the low-lying parts of the town, as far as the great
bazaar (zegyo), were inundated. It was a night of
peril and excitement, which taxed to the utmost the
energies of the officers in charge of Mandalay,
Captain Adamson, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Fforde. Till
the river began to fall the town remained under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
water, and we all went about the streets in boats
and launches. As the Burman is an amphibious
being, and the people in the area menaced by the
flood had ample warning, the loss of life was comparatively
small. Searching inquiry established the
conclusion that twelve persons were drowned. An
even more melancholy loss of life occurred in connection
with the distribution of rice to people rendered
destitute by the flood. In a crowd in a narrow
passage someone fell; the throng pushed forward
unknowing, and many people were trampled to death
before the press could be stayed.</p>

<p>One of the objects to which from the beginning
the Chief Commissioner devoted the full force of his
energy and influence was the continuation of the
railway from Toungoo to Mandalay. By dint of
constant and indefatigable pressure on the higher
powers, and by steadfast resistance to the suggestion
that a trunk road should first be made, he succeeded
in obtaining sanction for this essential work. The
survey was actually begun in the rains of 1886;
construction was started early in November of that
year; and in February, 1889, less than three years
after the proclamation of annexation, the line was
opened to traffic throughout its whole length. To
those who have experienced the delay usually attending
the grant of sanction to important and
costly proposals, the most remarkable feature of this
record is that leave should have been obtained in
less than a year from the occupation of Mandalay.
The construction of the line afforded work to great
numbers of Burmans and others, and proved one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
the most pacifying influences in the eastern districts.
There were no engineering difficulties, and the
climate enabled work to be carried on continuously
throughout the year. The opening of the railway
was hailed with joy by the Burmans, who expressed
their appreciation in characteristic fashion, greeting
passing trains with shouts of delight and crowding
to travel in the mi-yahta.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> It should never be forgotten
that to Sir Charles Bernard alone the
Province owes the inception of this work, as indeed
in earlier days to his far-seeing policy it owed the
construction of the railway from Rangoon to Pegu,
and thence to Toungoo. Apparently Sir Charles
Bernard furnished an exception to the rule that
Indian civilians are persons of narrow horizon.</p>

<p>Among the measures taken at an early stage to
facilitate the pacification of Upper Burma was the
disarmament of the people. Orders to effect this
were issued by Sir Charles Bernard, and some progress
was made. It was, however, under Sir
Charles Crosthwaite’s rule that, in the face of much
opposition, the whole Province was effectually disarmed.
No measure has had more excellent results
in the prevention of serious disturbances. Though
from time to time dacoits and robbers have become
possessed of firearms, the thoroughness of the disarmament
is proved by the inability of rebels in
recent years to obtain guns and powder. The Arms
Act has been very strictly enforced in Burma, the
number of firearms in each district being strictly
limited, with the most beneficial effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>In the time of King Mindôn and King Thebaw
many foreigners, mostly French and Italian, flocked
to Mandalay and obtained various appointments in
the King’s service. The downfall of the Burmese
kingdom deprived these gentlemen of their employment.
All had claims against the Burmese Government
for arrears of pay, for goods sold, or for work
done. Our Government naturally accepted responsibility
for the lawful debts of its predecessor.
The claims of foreign creditors were investigated
as quickly as possible, and those established were
discharged. Besides these, there were literally
hundreds of other demands for payment of sums
alleged to be due from the late Government. These
claims were laboriously investigated and reinvestigated,
and finally adjudicated upon by the Government
of India. Substantial payments were made in
settlement of debts sufficiently proved.</p>

<p>In those early days for most officers, military and
civil, in Mandalay life was a ceaseless round of
strenuous labour. For me it was intensely exciting.
All day and often far into the night my time was
fully occupied. The enthralling interest of seeing
from within and from the centre the making of a
new Province, of taking a humble share in the work,
was a privilege which falls to few men in a generation.
The receipt of reports from districts, the issue
of the Chief Commissioner’s orders, daily contact
with men of distinction in arms or civil affairs, the
early morning ride with my Chief or with a comrade,
sometimes even with the Commander-in-Chief, Sir
Frederick Roberts, of whose kindness I have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
pleasantest recollection, opportunities for the study
of Burmese life and character, filled to overflowing
the swiftly passing weeks. Bustle and excitement
and good fellowship formed an exhilarating combination.
All the holiday I had that year was a run
down to Rangoon for a day to see my wife and
family off to England. But who wanted holidays
at such a time, when his work was far more interesting
and stimulating than other people’s play?
With Stevenson we might say that we had “the
profit of industry with the pleasures of a pastime.”</p>

<p>It should hardly be necessary to say that in those
early months the outskirts and fringes, the Shan
States and the Chin and Kachin Hills, were untouched.
It has been suggested that in dealing
with the Shan country there was undue delay.
Anyone who realizes how much there was to do in
the plains, and how impossible it was to do everything
at once, recognizes the futility of the suggestion.
The Chins were left severely alone. The only
attempt made this year to penetrate into the Kachin
Hills was the luckless expedition to Pônkan,<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> which
returned to Bhamo <i>re infecta</i>, to the extreme wrath
of Sir Charles Bernard and Sir George White.</p>

<p>The Shan States occupied the whole of the east of
Burma, stretching even beyond the Mèkong River.
They constituted an integral part of the Burmese
Empire, but were administered by their own hereditary
chiefs, puny folk who grovelled before the
pinchbeck Majesty of Burma, and were on a footing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
quite inferior to that of native rulers in India.
The first of the Shan chiefs to open communication
with us was the Sawbwa<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> of Hsipaw, or, as the
Burmese called it, Thibaw, the State from which
the late King derived his title. This enlightened
chief had a romantic history which will bear retelling.
Some years before, having quarrelled with
the King, he fled for his life to Lower Burma.
With a few attendants he took up his residence in
Kemmendine, a suburb of Rangoon. Presently he
came to believe, very likely with good reason, that
at the King’s instigation two of his servants were
plotting his death. Accustomed in his State to
exercise the power of life and death, he tried them
in his own mind, found them guilty, and executed
them with his own hand, shooting them both. He
was tried by the Recorder of Rangoon (Mr. C. F.
Egerton Allen<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>) and a jury, convicted, and sentenced
to death. The capital sentence was at once commuted
to transportation for life, and the chief began
to serve his term in the Rangoon jail, where he was
at first set to do the usual hard labour required of
prisoners. Mr. Crosthwaite, who was acting as
Chief Commissioner, found him in this sad condition,
and ordered material alleviation of his lot. The
Sawbwa’s faithful Mahadevi,<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> who had accompanied
her husband, besieged the Chief Commissioner with
petitions for his release. Before long Mr. Crosthwaite
yielded to her importunity and set free the
Sawbwa on condition that he never returned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
British territory. He went to the independent
State of Karenni. At or about the time of the
occupation of Mandalay he made his way back to
Thibaw, and after a brief struggle regained possession
of his State.</p>

<p>Quite early in 1886 the Sawbwa wrote to me, as
Secretary to the Administration, saying that he had
received much kindness from the British Government,
and desired to be on terms of friendship with
us. It has always seemed to me that this was a
very magnanimous act. I agree that it also showed
much wisdom. The Sawbwa was a man of great
intelligence. He had seen and experienced the
power of the British Government. No doubt he
realized that he was dealing with a Government
immeasurably stronger than that which it had displaced,
and he saw his interest in being on good
terms with it. I think, too, that he had a shining
vision of becoming an independent Sovereign in
alliance with India. After all these deductions are
made, it implied true greatness of soul for a semi-civilized
chief to remember the clemency which had
spared his life, to forget the dock and the prison cell
and work-yard. The correspondence begun by the
Sawbwa was continued on cordial terms. Early in
1887, in spite of the passionate entreaties of his
advisers, who were filled with gloomy forebodings,
Kun Saing came down to Mandalay. This again
showed courage and foresight. There was not a
British officer or soldier in the length and breadth
of the Shan States. Mandalay was full of troops.
Though he brought a fairly large retinue, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Sawbwa knew that he was placing himself entirely in
our power. His confidence was more than justified.
He was received with some ceremony, Mr. J. E.
Bridges, C.S., and I, as representatives of Government,
meeting him at Aung-bin-le with a squadron
of cavalry and a military band. Under this escort
the Sawbwa made a triumphant entry into Mandalay,
and was allowed even to ride through the Palace
grounds. In the King’s time he might sooner have
hoped to fly over them. Sir Frederick Roberts and
Sir Charles Bernard were among the many spectators
of the procession. Accompanied by the
Mahadevi, the Sawbwa was suitably lodged in a
Win<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> outside the city walls. The ladies in his train
were somewhat scandalized at being photographed
by an enthusiastic amateur before they had time to
change out of riding kit. The Sawbwa’s amáts<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
continued in a state of alarm all the time they were
in Mandalay. Their terror rose almost to frenzy
when one day the Chief was taken for a picnic on
the river in an Indian Marine vessel. Even the
Chief was somewhat relieved when he landed safe
and sound on the Hard.</p>

<p>The Sawbwa had the luck to be in Mandalay at
the celebration of Queen Victoria’s first Jubilee.
Partly in honour of that auspicious occasion, partly
in recognition of his confidence and loyalty, the
tribute of Thibaw was remitted for ten years, and
three small adjacent States, Maing-lôn, Thônzè,
and Maing-tôn, to which very shadowy claims had
been preferred, were added to the Sawbwa’s terri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>tory.
Sir Charles Bernard’s action in making over
these States has been criticized. Viewing the case
calmly after the lapse of years, I humbly think that
his decision was wise. The suggestion of the risk of
creating a powerful Shan State strong enough to be
a menace to Government was plainly ridiculous. If
all the Shan States were united under one Chief, he
would not have as much power as the ruler of a
second-class native State in India. Thibaw with its
added sub-States could never be in a position to
cause the Government of Burma a moment’s anxiety.
On the other hand, a large and comparatively
wealthy State is more easily managed and likely to
be administered better than a lot of small tracts.</p>

<p class="caption smcap">The Sawbwa of Thibaw.</p>
</div>

<p>Although Kun Saing was not an ideal ruler;
although from time to time complaints were made
against him; although, I believe unjustly, even his
loyalty was doubted, he was an enlightened and
intelligent chief of some subtlety. Twice in later
years he visited England, where he had the honour
of being received by Her Majesty Queen Victoria.
The story, from first to last, has a ring of the Old
Testament. The place most of all admired by the
Sawbwa was the Crystal Palace (hman-nan-daw).
Towards the end of his life, when the first signs of
unrest in the East became dimly apparent, he is
said to have contracted a secret marriage with the
Pakangyi Supaya,<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> King Thebaw’s sister. Not that
he meditated treason; but if anything should happen,
he meant to be on the right side.</p>

<p>Two of Kun Saing’s sons were partly educated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
England. The elder, Saw Hkè, succeeded his father,
and is now the polished, courtly Chief of Thibaw.
The story of Saw Lu, the younger son, is pathetic
and instructive. When still a boy he was sent to
England, and was for a time at Rugby. He was a
studious and ambitious youth, whose desire was to
be, not a King, but a doctor. Most unwisely, merely
to see how he was getting on, his father recalled
him, and he was turned loose in Thibaw at the age
of about sixteen. The temptations besetting the
Chief’s young son in his father’s capital were too
strong for him, and he fell from grace. The cup of
his iniquity brimmed over when he eloped with a
young girl who had been selected as the Sawbwa’s
Abishag. The fugitives were brought back, and the
boy was cast into prison. “Is this your British
justice?” he indignantly asked the political officer
who came to condole with him. Presently he was
released, and came to see me in Rangoon. “I don’t
know what to do,” he said; “I have apologized to
the governor, but he won’t forgive me.” He was
an exceedingly good-looking, nice-mannered youth,
like a pleasant English public-school boy. He was
not allowed to return to England. Over his subsequent
history it is kinder to draw a veil. The moral
of this story is that if a Burman or Shan, especially
a Chief’s son, is to come to England, he should be
sent while still young, and should be kept at a good
public school and at the University until his character
has been formed. He should on no account
be brought back midway in the course of his
education.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>Even more deeply learned in Shan than in
Burmese, Pilcher would have been the first civil
officer in the Shan States. After his death, I was
designated by Sir Charles Bernard for that post.
When the time came, another officer was selected.
Speaking seriously and without reserve, I have no
doubt that this was for the advantage of the Shan
country. No one could have been more conspicuously
successful than Mr. Hildebrand<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> and Mr.
Scott;<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> no one is likely to have done nearly so well.
In view of the original intention, in the cold weather
of 1886 I was given a holiday from office-work, and
sent as civil officer with a column under Colonel E.
Stedman<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> to Thônzè. Through this State ran the
trade route to the Northern Shan States, Thibaw,
Theinni, and Taungbaing. Along this road came
caravans of bullocks laden with letpet.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Owing to
dissensions in Thônzè, the trade was stopped. The
object of our expedition, the first sent into the Shan
country, was to obtain information and to open the
road for traders. Early in November, when the
season should have been settled, on a fine Sunday
afternoon, I rode out to join the rearguard at Tônbo.
Next morning we were to catch up the main column
at Zibingale. From Tônbo to Zibingale we climbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
the hill in a torrent of rain, letting our ponies loose
to scramble up the steep and rocky ascent, while
the Gurkhas chaffed one another and laughed at the
weather. At Zibingale we stayed under canvas in
the rain for three days and three nights, quite comfortable
in our tents, but rather aggrieved at having
to wade knee-deep in mud to mess.</p>

<p>The Madrasi garrison of the post was prostrate
with fever almost to a man; of our own small force
about a quarter fell sick. By judicious doses of
quinine, I saved my servants and myself, so that we
all came through unscathed. After three days the
rain ceased and we began our march in cool
November sunshine. On that delightful plateau,
some three thousand feet above the sea, the winter
climate is perfect. We rode through forest paths
and fairy glades, wild roses clustering in the hedges.
At Pyintha and Singaing, we first saw the bazaar,
held every five days, a custom peculiar to the Shan
States and Further East. Buyers and sellers came
from all the countryside, often from distant places.
It is much like market-day in a country town in
England. The market at Singaing and at Pyinulwin
was of some interest, and attracted strange folk
from the hills. It was not to be compared with the
great bazaars held at Kēngtūng, Namkham, or even
Mogôk, thronged with many varieties of races in
rich diversities of attire. To us, the people most
novel and attractive were the Shans, men swaggering
in baggy trousers and large flapping straw hats
brigand-like, but formidable only in appearance; girls
with russet-rosy cheeks, shy and gentle. Pyin-u-lwin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
a charmingly situated village of some five-and-twenty
houses, with a market-place and a gambling
ring, won our hearts. Though we did not actually
discover Pyin-u-lwin, we were among its earliest
visitors. We were received with all kindness and
hospitality. Several of us were housed in the village
monastery, where we were heartily welcomed by the
monk. He was still there when I left Burma
twenty-four years later. With Captain E. W. Dun,
our Intelligence Officer, I inspected a curious
magnetic rock in the neighbouring jungle. Some
years afterwards it was described as a new discovery
by a geologist of note. It has been lost again, but
will doubtless be found some day. Soon after our
return, on Colonel Stedman’s recommendation, a
military post was established at Pyin-u-lwin, and
called May-my̆o, after Colonel May, of the Bengal
army, a Mutiny veteran, the first Commandant.
May-my̆o is now the summer residence of the Burma
Government and the headquarters of the Burma
division, a flourishing hill-station with a population
of about 12,000. Without pretension to the picturesque,
it is a place of great charm and quiet beauty,
with no palm-trees and few pagodas, conspicuously
un-Oriental, more like a corner of Surrey than of
Burma.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>From Pyin-u-lwin we marched to Thônzè, through
a desolate country, overgrown with elephant-grass,
but with many signs of past prosperity. At the
ruined town of Thônzè, now no more than a strag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>gling
village, we halted and tried to open communication
with Hein Sè,<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> a bandit who claimed to
be Chief of the State. I promised him a safe-conduct
and liberty to depart if we could not come
to terms, and to encourage him, I offered to let him
keep my messenger as a hostage for his safety.
This offer was made with the knowledge and consent
of the messenger, a little Shan chiefling known as
the Tabet Myosa. Him we had found, practically
destitute, in Mandalay, where he had been detained
by the King. As a matter of grace, he was given
an allowance of Rs. 10<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> a month. He accompanied
me on this tour, and pluckily undertook to carry my
letter to Hein Sè. As he was leaving, he turned at
the tent-door, and said: “But you will let him
come back, won’t you?” Accepting my assurance,
he went off. I know that he discharged his mission,
as I received a reply. But his courage was not put
to the extreme test. Hein Sè behaved like a gentleman,
treated the envoy kindly, and sent him back
in safety. He himself declined my invitation. The
future history of Tabet may be told here. A few
months later, when Mr. Hildebrand and Mr. Scott
went to the Shan States, I sent the Myosa with
them. He made himself useful, and showed nerve
and ability. When, owing to the persistent recalcitrance
of its ruler, who fled across the Salween
and stayed there, the large State of Yatsauk was in
need of a chief, Tabet was chosen. He ruled Yat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>sauk
with loyalty and intelligence, and handed down
the succession to his son. His fortune, probably his
merit, was better than that of another Shan chiefling
of similar status, the Maingkaing Myosa, who also
received from Government 13s. 4d. a month, and
received no more.</p>

<p>The rest of this tour was without incident. We
explained to the people of Thônzè the beneficent
intentions of Government, and gave a practical
example of the good manners of a British military
force. The Gurkhas of the column, then as ever,
were specially popular with the people to whom
doubtless they are akin.</p>

<p>In February, 1887, Mandalay was not behind the
rest of India in celebrating the Jubilee of Her
Majesty Queen Victoria. The ceremonies were
designedly arranged so as to give the people an
opportunity of demonstrating their loyalty and
devotion to the Crown by revels which they themselves
appreciated. For a week pwès<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> and other
Burmese festivities went on day and night. On the
first day came all the members of the royal family,
all the high officials, and a crowd of others, in their
gayest and richest attire. In the principal ballet
appeared, probably for the last time, the famous
singer and dancer, Yindaw Ma Le, the favourite of
Princes, undisputed <i>prima donna</i> of the Burmese
operatic stage, who ten years before had been sent
to Rangoon by Mindôn Min to dance at the Proclamation
rejoicings. Twenty years later her
successor, Ma Twe Le, also a lady of supreme grace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
and serpentine charm,<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> had the honour of dancing
before Their Royal Highnesses the Prince and
Princess of Wales.</p>

<p>One of the relaxations of those early days was to
see the working of the Elephant Kheddah at
Amarapura. The Kheddah establishment, inherited
from the King and maintained for some time, consisted
of a number of tame elephants, thoroughly
well trained, with Burmese riders and hunters.
The tame elephants, some with riders, some guided
only by their own sagacity, plunged into a jungle
teeming with herds of their wild brethren. By
artful strategy a wild elephant would be detached
from his fellows, lured into the midst of the tame
herd, and gradually drawn to the Kheddah enclosure.
This was a quadrangle, entered only by a
funnel-shaped passage, surrounded by a strong outer
wall of brick and by an inner stockade of stout teak
posts set at intervals, with a space between the
stockade and the wall. By his clever, perfidious
friends, the captive was cunningly edged and hustled
towards the passage till finally he was thrust into
its mouth. Then the gate was securely fastened
and the quarry was alone at the mercy of his
captors. The hunters teased him with blunt spears
and sticks, not doing him any real harm, but annoying
him exceedingly, escaping his charge by darting
between the posts of the palisade, set wide enough
apart to admit a man but not an elephant. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
was a sport of some danger, requiring nerve and
agility. When the poor beast was thoroughly tired,
he was noosed and tied up in the Kheddah, and the
process of training began. Spectators sat in crowds
on the wall to watch this pastime. I do not think
it occurred to any of us that it was somewhat cruel.</p>

<p>In March, 1887, Sir Charles Bernard left Burma.
He was entertained by the Headquarters Mess at a
farewell dinner, where Sir George White<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> proposed
his health in moving and eloquent terms, quoting
most appropriately the famous lines:</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
A FEW WORDS ON BUDDHISM</h2>

<p>Buddhist monks are the most influential and most
respected class of the community. In passing it
may be mentioned that there is no such person as a
Buddhist priest. No one exercises any sacerdotal
function or celebrates any Sacrament. The religious
are not priests, but monks, a numerous and well-organized
body, wielding indefinite but real authority.
In every village at least one monk is found. In
Mandalay, the typical Burmese city, they were
numbered by thousands. Professed monks are
bound by vows of chastity and poverty, and are
subject to strict discipline. Wearing the yellow
robe, the distinctive mark of their order, as morning
comes round monks and novices from every
monastery walk slowly through the streets, each
bearing a bowl for the receipt of the offerings of the
faithful. We must not call this vessel a “begging-bowl.”
One of the many acts from which a monk
is bound to abstain is asking for anything. Voluntary
gifts are freely offered, and are received as a
matter of course. The lives of monks are devoted
to meditation, the practice of austerities, the study
and exposition of the law, the instruction of youth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Every Burmese boy enters a monastery, stays for a
longer or shorter period, and receives there the
elements of secular learning. Also, much to his
profit, he is instructed in religious and moral duties.
Thus it happens that in Burma elementary education
is widely spread. The proportion of literate
persons is greater than in any country where education
is not compulsory. It is rare to find a man
who cannot at least read and write. Sometimes
men profess to have forgotten these arts, but as a
rule this is mere laziness. The influence of monks
having remained undisturbed by foreign contact,
five-and-twenty years ago sound education in the
vernacular was more common in Upper Burma than
in the rest of the Province. In my own Court in
Mandalay, in comparatively early days, a Lower
Burman clerk was stumbling over the reading of a
document. A bystander, apparently a plain man,
offered his services. Borrowing a pair of spectacles
from his neighbour, he read the crabbed text with
fluency and accuracy. The incident does not prove,
but it illustrates, my argument.</p>

<a name="illo_14" id="illo_14"></a><img src="images/i_217.jpg" width="600" height="361" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Monastery with carving.</p>
</div>

<p>Apart from the instruction of youth and the
exposition of the law, monks are not supposed
to take an interest in mundane affairs. Their
aloofness has been exaggerated. In a country
village, for example, the monk was obviously the
most learned and disinterested, very likely the most
intelligent, person. Inevitably he was sought as the
arbitrator of disputes. That monks often acted in
that capacity, I have found abundant evidence in
old documents produced before me in court. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
of these went back a hundred years, when the
country was quite free from foreign influence, and
cannot be regarded as indicating degeneracy of the
monastic order. Again, it has been said that the
authority of monks depended solely on their personal
qualities and religious character, that it had no
secular sanction. As regards Upper Burma in the
King’s time, nothing can be farther from the
truth. Buddhist ecclesiastics relied on the arm of
flesh. The King and his officers promptly and
effectually enforced the commands of the hierarchy.
Laymen were severely punished for ecclesiastical
offences, and recalcitrant monks were imprisoned
within the precincts of a pagoda, or compelled to do
acts of penance. In early days in Mandalay one
Deputy Commissioner essayed to maintain the
ancient rule, and to give effect to monastic sentences.
Unfortunately this good practice could not
last. Now the hierarchy complain that, as Government
will not enforce discipline, authority is waning,
with disastrous results. The most that the Courts
have found possible is to give effect to decisions of
duly constituted religious tribunals in disputes of a
civil nature between members of the order. Another
instance of the interference of monks in worldly
affairs, their almost invariable complicity in political
intrigues, has been already mentioned. The Kinwun
Mingyi himself emerged from a monastery to take
part in the rebellion which placed Mindôn Min on
the throne.</p>

<p>On the whole, in Upper Burma as we found it,
the monks constituted a respectable body, including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
many learned and devout persons. I do not pretend
that all were immaculate. Doubtless there
were idle and dissolute monks. One hears from
Burmans themselves of some who were monks by
day and who at night threw off the yellow robe
and ranged the town. Some of them dabbled
in magic and alchemy. A really pious monk could
hardly become a dacoit chief. But the great
majority honestly lived up to their profession. The
fact that the vows were not irrevocable tended to
prevent the occurrence of scandals sometimes incident
to monastic life. Complete liberty of renunciation
lessened temptation to break the vows. It
was always open to a monk to return to the world
and, as it was phrased, again to become a man.
Even if a shadow of discredit attached to a monk
who had come out (twet), it was faint and transitory.
In a land where life is simple and much
concealment impossible, no body of men who lived
unworthily could retain the respect of all classes.
Every layman, from the King downwards, treated
monks as superior beings. I have seen the Kinwun
Mingyi lean out of his carriage and pay the graceful
Burmese reverence<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> to a humble passing monk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>In Upper Burma the fine flower of Buddhism
flourished. The monastic system was elaborately
organized. At the head was the Thathanabaing;
under him were Gaing-ôks, Gaingdauks, and Taik-ôks,<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
in due succession and subordination. The
Thathanabaing was not, as some suppose, elected;
he was appointed by the King. In former days his
authority prevailed throughout Burma. As by
degrees fragments of the country became British
territory, the Thathanabaing’s jurisdiction naturally
shrank, being restricted to the King’s dominions.
Even if for no other reason, it was impossible for
British officers to recognize in Lower Burma the
authority of a monk who lived in Ava or Mandalay,
and owed his power and appointment to a foreign
monarch. Consequently the bonds of discipline
were relaxed. Monks and laity in Lower Burma
were as sheep without a shepherd. Heresies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
schisms rent the Buddhist Church. The influence
of monks waned perceptibly. Buddhism was and is
still a living creed in Lower Burma. But it cannot be
pretended that it is so vital and beneficent a force
as even now in the Upper districts. Similarly, as
already indicated, monastic education declined.
The absence of ecclesiastical control has caused some
deterioration of character in Lower Burma.</p>

<p>The policy of the Government of India has always
been to observe strict neutrality in religious matters,
to interest itself in no form of creed. All education
directed by Government has been rigidly secular.
It is now felt by many that this policy, however
well-intentioned, was mistaken, that in allowing, or
even encouraging education to be exclusively
secular, Government has done much to sap the
foundations of morality and loyalty, to undermine
the basis of character. Probably the right course
would have been not to stand aloof from the divers
creeds of the Empire, but to take an active interest
in all, and to see that each had fair play and
encouragement. For a Christian Government to do
this would have been difficult; most likely the attempt
would not have been tolerated by public opinion
at home. So far as India is concerned, the tiresome
thing about public opinion in England is that,
where interest might be beneficial, it cannot be
roused; while in some vital matter in which only
the man on the spot has materials for judging, the
British public, or its spokesmen, insist on interfering.
(How pleasant would it be, for instance, to see on
newspaper posters such legends as&mdash;</p>

<p class="center large">ANOTHER WRONG TO BURMA.</p>

<p class="center">BURMA’S SAD FINANCIAL STATE.</p>

<p>How unlikely we are to see them!) Perhaps of the
two mistakes lack of interest is the less mischievous.
Recently we have made a step in advance. Religious
teaching in State schools has been permitted; all
pupils may receive instruction in the creeds which
they profess.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Bernard recognized the value of
monastic influence, and did his best to enlist it on
the side of law and order. It was particularly
desirable that monks should be discouraged from
taking part in political agitation. It was also
hoped that the monastic system of education might
be maintained and strengthened in sympathy with
our own Education Department. At the time of
the annexation the Thathanabaing was a weak but
well-meaning person who had been King Thebaw’s
tutor. The Chief Commissioner interviewed him in
person and essayed to excite his enthusiasm for the
new Government. In recognition of the part taken
by monks in secular education, monthly gifts of rice
were sent to the Thathanabaing and his trusted
counsellors, the Pă-kán and Hladwe Sadaws. The
Thathanabaing was induced to visit Rangoon with
a view to the extension of his authority over Lower
Burma. Government provided for his journey,
which was made in some state with a long train of
monks. He was received with rapture at Prome
and in Rangoon; and a rest-house (zayat) for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
and his successors was built on the slope of the
Shwe Dagôn Pagoda. The effort was ineffectual.
Neither that Thathanabaing nor his successors have
exercised any power in Lower Burma, which still
remains in a state of reprobation. Another attempt
was made to conciliate Buddhist sympathy. Many
monasteries and other religious buildings had been
used by troops and others for Government purposes,
and some damage had been done. All over the
country monks had hospitably received and entertained
our officers, and had raised no objection to
the necessary temporary use of sacred buildings.
As a compensation for disturbance and damage, a
substantial sum of money was disbursed to a large
number of monks. As monks may not touch gold
or silver, the actual coins were placed in the hands
of lay followers. These well-meant efforts had, I
fear, no appreciable effect. The Thathanabaing had
not the authority, even if he had the will, to control
and direct his monks by moral force alone. Monks
were civil to British officers, often glad to have the
protection of a military post; but they did not go
out of their way to preach submission to an heretical
Government. It is hardly to be expected that they
would do so.</p>

<div class="center">
<a name="illo_15" id="illo_15"></a><img src="images/i_225.jpg" width="293" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">The Thatha-na-baing.</p>
</div>

<p>After this Thathanabaing had condescended to
return, as runs the Burmese euphemism for the
death of a monk, it was some years before Government
made up its mind as to the appointment of a
successor. No one could lawfully be Thathanabaing
unless appointed by the ruling power. But it was
contrary to established principle for Government to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
appoint a Buddhist ecclesiastic. For some years the
monastic world was given up to anarchy. At last
it was decided that, though Government could not
appoint, it might recognize; and though it could
not give material aid, it might lend moral support.
To ascertain the monk who would be generally
acceptable, an election was held. This device has
now been adopted on two or three occasions, so that
people have begun to believe that it was always
customary. The last two holders of the office have
been formally recognized by the Government of
Burma; the present Thathanabaing received a
sanad<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> from the Lieutenant-Governor. He is a
monk of learning, and particular suavity of manner
and disposition. While maintaining due reserve and
dignity, he has always been on excellent terms with
Government and its officers. He has loyally exercised
his influence on the side of law and order, and
has tried to smooth the path of the Education
Department, anxious to link the monastic with the
Government system. Without posing as liberal or
progressive, he has been wise and conciliatory. In
later years my personal relations with the Thathanabaing
were extremely cordial. Once he honoured
me by his presence at a garden-party in Mandalay.
This was, I think, an unprecedented occasion. On
the lovely lawn fringing the moat he sat, surrounded
by yellow-robed counsellors, the centre of a picturesque
circle, watched with reverence by Burmese,
with respectful interest by European and Indian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
guests. Among my most treasured possessions is a
rosary which he sent me, with a charming farewell
letter, when I left the Province.</p>

<p>The order of Buddhist nuns must not be forgotten.
They are comparatively few in number,
and, though regarded with respect, do not seem
to exercise special influence. Living sometimes in
seclusion, sometimes in communities, they occupy no
prominent place. Their lives are spent in meditation
and devotion, free from secular cares. Often when
stricken by a great sorrow a woman becomes a nun,
and adheres to her profession for the rest of her life.
Innocent, harmless ladies, if they are not active in
good works their passive piety is a gracious example.
A nun whom you meet in the road has a pleasing
habit of invoking a blessing as you pass.</p>

<p>Buddhism as professed by the Burmese is of a
high and pure type. In Burma, and in Burma alone
throughout India,<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Buddhism is a vital force. The
suggestion that religion is in danger, or that monks
have been ill-used, is the surest way to rouse popular
feeling. The ethics of Buddhism are as lofty and
inspiring as those of any faith in the world.
Obviously Burmans do not invariably shape their
lives in strict accordance with the precepts of the
law. But in spite of failings and shortcomings, the
spiritual and moral force of their religion sheds a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
penetrating influence on national life and character.
Though its every rule may be daily violated,
Buddhism does tend to make Burmans humane,
tolerant, kind-hearted, charitable. All Burmans are
well-grounded in the mysteries of their faith. When
they sin, they sin against light and conscience. In
all but the most abandoned, traces of the good
influence of their religion are evident. One very
pleasing effect is extension of benevolence in theory
always, in practice often, to every sentient being.
Consider, for instance, the kindly attitude of Burmans
to lower animals. From the plump bullocks which
draw the primitive, creaking<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> carts of the country
to the pariah dogs which swarm in every village, or
the pigs which used to scavenge the streets of
Mandalay (whose chase, not by the Burmese, was
the only form of pig-sticking known in Burma), all
are objects of compassion and care. The Burman’s
robust bullocks, nourished on their mothers’ milk,
contrast pleasingly with the lean kine of the Indian.
You will even see a pious Burman save a deadly
snake from destruction, and set it loose in a place of
security. This, perhaps, is an extreme instance of
logical regard for principle.</p>

<p>Signs of the extent to which religion forms part
of everyday life strike the most casual observer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
The country is full of pagodas, monasteries, theins,<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
images of the Buddha, zayats. Pagodas vary in size
from the stately Shwe Dagôn to the humble fane on
the outskirts of a village. It may be worth while to
explain that a pagoda is not a temple in which
worshippers pay their devotions. It is a solid structure,
often built over sacred relics, of varying type,
the most prevalent being that of the great pagoda
at Rangoon. Some pagodas are richly gilded, others
merely whitewashed. Each is crowned with a ti,
if possible studded with jewels. The very topmost
pinnacle is often an inverted soda-water bottle, a
primitive shield against lightning. Monks must
have monasteries. These also differ in glory, from
the great buildings, richly ornamented with carving
covered with gold, founded by the King or Queen
or some high official, which adorn the royal city, to
the mat and thatched hut which shelters the poor
village monk. A Burman who amasses wealth, the
farmer who has an abundant harvest and good
prices, the merchant whose venture has been successful,
the rich broker or money-lender, does not
hoard his gains. He spends them on jewels for his
wife and daughters, on silks for these ladies and
himself, on building a monastery, or a pagoda, a
zayat, incidentally on a pwè<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> or an ahlu.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
builder of a pagoda is a Paya-taga, of a monastery a
Kyaung-taga, honorific titles in familiar use, as
common as the title of Colonel is said to be in the
United States. Laymen are associated in religious
observances. A monastery has a lay attendant, a
Kappiya-taga, who makes it his business to see
that the building is maintained and duly swept and
garnished. Every eighth day is set apart by the
pious for religious observances, for meditation, for
visiting a pagoda, for attendance at a monastery to
hear the Law expounded. Each year there is a long
Lenten period (Wa), when abstinence and religious
practices are enjoined on the faithful, when good
Buddhists refrain from marrying, when monks remain
secluded in their monasteries, undertaking
no journeys. A monk reckons his monastic life by
the number of Lents he has observed. All this
sounds rather gloomy, and in theory Buddhism
ought to have a depressing effect. It teaches the
transitoriness and mutability of this world and of
all human things. No personal God smiles on his
worshippers or listens to their prayers. This life is
an evil in itself, a period to be spent in the acquisition
of merit, in preparation for the ascent to a
higher plane. The goal of every man’s striving is
the blessed rest of Nirvana (Neikban), a state, not
of annihilation, but of rest for many ages from
passion and all transitory disturbance. For even
the rest of Nirvana is not eternal. After many
æons, it may be, the unceasing round begins again.
The practical effect of this austere creed is quite
different. Nowhere is there a more gay and light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>-hearted
people. To balance the days and months of
abstinence, religious festivals are of frequent occurrence.
Then the roads are crowded with cart-loads
of merry holiday-makers. Pagoda platforms are
filled with bright-clad, laughing throngs. Pwès and
all national sports are celebrated. On every side are
gaiety and good-humour, the basis of religion underlying
all. It is not for me to attempt to explain
these apparent inconsistencies.</p>

<p>The people in general soon made up their minds
that there was no intention of interfering with their
religion. And, in spite of isolated instances, the
monks accepted the new order with resignation, if
not with enthusiasm. The tolerant spirit of Buddhism
pervades all classes. Strangers wander unmolested
and without meeting scowling looks in the
precincts of pagodas and holy places; they are
welcome to explore the recesses of monasteries,
observing only common politeness and decorum.
You are not expected to take off your shoes on
reaching the sacred limits of a pagoda or monastery.
Ordinary courtesy doubtless impels you to remove
your hat in a sacred building. It is not really
correct to walk across the sleeping mat of a Sadaw,<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
as I saw done by a lady who should have known
better. The Sadaw only laughed, recognizing that
no offence was meant.</p>

<p>Pagodas and sacred images are left to the care of
the people themselves, tempered by the benevolent
patronage of the Archæological Survey. In too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
many cases these buildings and objects are left to
the process of natural decay. It seems to be somewhat
more meritorious to build a new shrine than
to keep in repair an existing fabric. Probably the
builder of a new pagoda, for instance, earns all the
merit for himself, while a restorer shares it with the
original founder. In the case of edifices of special
sanctity or conspicuous antiquarian or architectural
interest, arrangements have been made, at the instigation
of Government, to vest the property and
management in legally appointed trustees. The
care and maintenance of sacred buildings and the
due appropriation of pious offerings are thus assured.
Not only for the Shwe Dagôn Pagoda and the Arakan
Pagoda at Rangoon and Mandalay respectively, but
for many shrines of less fame, trustees have been
appointed. This is the best way of securing the
preservation of religious buildings of inestimable
interest.</p>

<p>One of the most striking personalities in modern
Burmese Buddhism is the Ledi Sadaw. This remarkable
man devoted some years of his life to
travelling through the country preaching and exhorting.
His passionate eloquence drew immense
congregations. Wherever he went he was greeted
by enraptured throngs. Men and women vied in
adoration of this saintly personage, women loosing
their hair and spreading it as a carpet for his holy
feet. His fervour and fiery zeal effected real
revivals, whether lasting or transitory I dare not
say. Besides addressing public assemblies, he
obtained leave to enter jails and preach reformation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
to the prisoners, apparently with good results.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> In
spite of the extraordinary enthusiasm which he
inspired and the honours thrust upon him in his
triumphal progress, he preserved unstained and
flawless, simplicity and humility of character. We
are not wont to regard with favour errant monks
preaching here and there. Too often their exhortations
have tended to sedition, their liberty has been
a cloak for licence. Never for a moment did the
Ledi Sadaw fall under a shadow of suspicion as to
the purity of his motives and conduct, or the good
intention of his pilgrimage. The ethical part of his
sermons consisted of fervent denunciations of intemperance,
drinking, gambling, opium-smoking, the
pleasant vices most devastating among Burmans.
In no way inspired by any Government officer, he
did not hold aloof from the authorities, but desired
to be on good terms with them. Speaking to
Colonel Maxwell,<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> who more than most of us won
the intimate confidence of Burmans, in all simplicity
he said:</p>

<p>“I am not sure that Government will approve my
preaching. There will be much loss of revenue; for
when I have finished, all liquor and opium shops will
be closed for want of custom.”</p>

<p>With a clear conscience the Commissioner bade
him go on and prosper, assuring him that Government
would be well pleased if so desirable a result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
could be attained. The promised millennium has not
yet arrived. While heartily approving the Sadaw,
we did not think it expedient to make our approval
conspicuous, lest plausibly, though falsely, the suggestion
might be made that he was an agent of the
Asoya.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> A travelling set of the Buddhist scriptures
was the only mark of Government’s appreciation. I
had the privilege of one interview with this extraordinary
man. What chiefly impressed me was his
weary expression, as though the working of the fiery
spirit had worn out the frail tenement of the body.
I am glad to hear that the Sadaw still lives, and
that his preaching days are not over.</p>

<p>One of the last incidents of my residence in
Burma may fitly conclude this discursive chapter.
Early in 1910 we were privileged to receive what
are believed to be genuine relics of the Buddha.
They were discovered by the Archæological Survey
near Peshawar. Their authenticity has, I believe,
been doubted. I hope I am not, to use the happy
phrase of an Irish friend, more prone than most men
to swallow mares’-nests. But to me the evidence of
the genuine character of the relics seems reasonably
convincing. It was my fortunate lot to be instrumental
in securing the despatch of these precious
remains to Burma, where alone, as I have said, the
pure spirit of Buddhism still reigns; and to be present
when, with due solemnity, at Government House in
Calcutta, the Viceroy graciously entrusted the
casket and its priceless contents to a deputation sent
from Burma to receive them. The relics were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
welcomed in Rangoon with demonstrations of pious
enthusiasm, and brought by a long procession to the
Shwe Dagôn Pagoda, where, for some days, they
were exhibited for the edification of the faithful.
Thence they were taken to Mandalay and placed in
the care of the elders of the Arakan Pagoda till a
separate suitable shrine can be erected in custody
of a duly constituted trust.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
UNDER SIR CHARLES CROSTHWAITE, 1887-1890</h2>

<p>Mr. C. H. T. Crosthwaite, soon afterwards Sir
Charles Crosthwaite, K.C.S.I., succeeded Sir Charles
Bernard. He came enjoying the confidence of the
Viceroy, and in just expectation of the support of
the Government of India. Taking in hand at once
the settlement of the country, in the next four years
he devoted his remarkable administrative genius to
the completion of the task. I cannot becomingly
express in full my humble appreciation and admiration
of Sir Charles Crosthwaite and the great work
which he accomplished in Burma. I hope it is not
presumptuous of me to say that as an administrator
he ranks in the very highest class of Indian Statesmen,
and is at this moment by far the most distinguished
member of our Service. Never sparing
himself, in those eventful years he initiated, guided,
directed, controlled. In his officers he inspired
enthusiasm; we would have fallen in harness to
serve him or win his approval. We were always
sure of strong and efficient support, and had no fear,
if things went wrong, of being thrown to the dogs.
Sir Charles Crosthwaite came to a land still torn by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
internal strife; he left it a peaceful and prosperous
Province. I speak of what I know, for from first to
last it was my privilege to work immediately under
him, to see the pulse of the machine. Let those
who wish to understand turn to the book<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> wherein
the story of the pacification is modestly told by the
chief actor in the drama.</p>

<p>Early in March, 1887, the Chief Commissioner
came to Mandalay, retaining for a short time the
separate Secretariat for Upper Burma. Wisely distrusting
the sanitary conditions of the palace, he
took up his quarters in a small house built on the
city wall, intended as the residence of a military
police officer. It consisted of two or three rooms
under one of the pyathats.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> On the first evening
after the Chief Commissioner’s arrival we waited
some time for dinner, as the roof of the cook-room
was blown off by a sudden gale. Since those days
the building has expanded, and has become a respectable
Government House. Thanks to the good
taste of the Chief Engineer, Mr. H. J. Richard,
Burmese style has been preserved. The pyathat is
the centre of a range of buildings which might be a
monastery or a section of the Palace. Thus the
house is a picturesque feature in the landscape, not
an outrage. With the moat and a stretch of green
lawn on one side, and pretty gardens on the other,
commanding a fine view of Mandalay Hill and the
rugged western hillocks, it has every æsthetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
quality. It may be whispered that it is more beautiful
to see than comfortable to inhabit.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Crosthwaite’s first tour was undertaken
for the purpose of visiting the Ruby Mines
district, then recently occupied. A military station
had been established on a lofty, somewhat bleak
plateau, and honoured with the name of Bernardmy̆o.
The civil headquarters were at Mogôk, the centre of
the ruby mines. Reaching Ky̆an-hny̆at by steamer,
we rode to Sagadaung, at the foot of the hills,
breakfasting midway with Mr. R. C. Stevenson,<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
the subdivisional officer. The Chief Commissioner’s
party consisted of the Personal Assistant<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> and myself.
At Sagadaung it was found that all the servants,
panic-stricken at the thought of plunging into savage
wilds, had refused to leave the steamer. The kit
and stores had come on, but the only servants with
us were my Madrasi boy and a few chapràsis.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> The
Personal Assistant was equal to the occasion. He
invited all the officers of the Station to dine with
the Chief Commissioner, from whom the state of
affairs was concealed. “And,” said he, “as our men
are rather tired, will you let your cooks help to get
dinner ready?” These assistants he supplied with
stores and necessaries, and dinner was successfully
achieved. Next morning we rode up the hill to
Bernardmy̆o, where we were kindly made honorary
members of the mess and lodged as handsomely as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Service conditions allowed. I slept in a commissariat
godown,<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> with the wind, cold even in April, whistling
through the openings in the boarded floor. After a
day or two we rode on to Mogôk, through lovely
evergreen forest which still shades the bridle-path.
There we were guests of the Deputy Commissioner,
the late Mr. G. M. S. Carter, who cherished us till
we reached the river and our steamer once more.
Never, I ween, not even in the Spartan days of Sir
Arthur Phayre, did a Chief Commissioner make an
official tour in his Province with only a third of
a boy and a stray chapràsi or two as bearer,<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
khitmagar,<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> and cook.</p>

<p>The Ruby Mines Company was still in embryo,
but the syndicate out of which it was evolved had
established a footing, and Mr. F. Atlay, who still
manages its affairs, was already installed. The
quest for rubies was prosecuted by the hereditary
miners, who worked by primitive native methods.
In the King’s time rubies were, naturally, a royal
monopoly, and any stone of exceptional value was
a royal perquisite. The most illustrious stone on
record was called, after its finder, Chin Nga Mauk.
The lucky man himself took it to the Palace, and
was privileged to lay it at the King’s feet. As a
reward he was allowed to take away a cart-load of
whatever he liked from the Palace. The legend of
the discovery of the mines may be told. Passing
through a desolate, unpeopled land, a wayfarer saw
a vulture swoop from a solitary rock and pick up a
piece of, as it seemed to wayfarer and apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
to vulture, raw red flesh. Surprised at such a
phenomenon in a waste place, the traveller investigated,
and found the earth strewn with lovely
glittering red stones, thenceforth known as the
rubies of commerce. The truth of the story is
proved by the existence to this day of the rock on
which the vulture perched. Times have changed,
and rubies are no longer picked up on the surface.
Nor are they found embedded in the stone walls of
Aladdin’s caves. They are extracted by washing
from ruby-bearing earth (by̆ôn), which is borne in
trucks to the Company’s washing sheds. Each truck
contains, I suppose, about twelve cubic feet of earth;
the average value is about one shilling. But any
load may produce a stone worth a King’s ransom.
Besides the scientific operations of the company,
mining by native methods is still practised. The
rights of hereditary miners are preserved. They
pursue the quest after the manner of their fathers,
on payment of a moderate licence-fee. The very
poor, mostly women, may glean in the beds of
streams without any restriction. Ruby-mining was
a profitable business, with a pleasing element of
chance. Some lucky miners amassed large fortunes.
Even the common people were affluent. The smallest
coin current in the bazaar was a silver two-anna
(2d.) piece. Coppers were unknown. In later days
the Chief Commissioner or Lieutenant-Governor’s
receptions at Mogôk were ceremonies of much
splendour. Followed by scores of mounted men
who came to meet him, he rode through the town
under triumphal arches gleaming with silken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
banners, past lines of cheering spectators, groups
of dancers, and cymbal-clashing musickers, while
pretty, shy Shan girls peeped from the casements.
An incident of one of these visits, though it has
nothing to do with rubies or ceremonious receptions,
may be recorded by way of comic relief. The scene
was the parade-ground; the occasion, an inspection
of the Military Police Battalion; the time, the end
of summer. The ground was wet and slippery from
an early unexpected shower. After the accustomed
evolutions, the Commandant, an exceptionally smart,
well-turned-out officer, came galloping up to the
Lieutenant-Governor, and as he essayed to pull up
within a yard of that august personage his pony
slipped and deposited him in the mud at his feet.
Nowise abashed, he rose, gravely saluted: “Would
you like to see anything else, sir?” “No, thank
you,” was the equally grave reply. And the incident
closed, to their credit, be it told, not one of
the staff moving a muscle. As the story goes, they
waited to laugh till they got home.</p>

<p>On our return from the first visit, our baggage
borne on mules, we rode to Thabeik-kyin along a
mule-track following approximately the line of the
present road. The narrow path wound through and
about the hills, often with a yawning precipice on
one hand, a wall of rock on the other. But that the
road is broad and smooth, in many respects it
resembles the old path. Ponies have still a horrid
habit of hugging the cliff’s edge, and one rides with
a leg suspended over the abyss. To meet a train of
pack-bullocks charging down the pass is a trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
experience. So, too, is the ascent in a motor-car
with a driver learning his work. Green forest
covers the hillsides and luxuriates in the valleys,
brilliant with many-coloured blooms. The cicala
fills the open spaces with sound, so great a noise by
so small a body. It was then all new and full of
interest. The beauty of the landscape charmed
every step of the march. Our guide was a handsome
ruffian, Bo Aw, as picturesque as the scene,
who rode ahead in Shan dress, his flapping straw
hat decked with gay streamers. Afterwards he
returned to the life of a dacoit, and, I fear, came to
a bad end.</p>

<p>Soon after this, the Mandalay Secretariat ceased
to exist as a separate branch, one Secretariat, with a
Chief Secretary, Secretary, Junior Secretary, and
Assistant Secretary, being constituted in Rangoon
for the whole Province. Mr. Symes became Chief
Secretary, but, worn out by many labours, went on
leave, Mr. Donald Smeaton<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> coming from India to
act for him. I became Secretary, and Mr. C. G.
Bayne, Junior Secretary. The anomalous post of
Special Commissioner was abolished, Mr. Hodgkinson
going to Moulmein as Commissioner. Mr.
Smeaton was not new to the Province. Some years
before he had come to Burma to fill the newly
created office of Revenue Secretary and Director of
Agriculture. In that capacity he had devised and
organized the Supplementary Survey system, afterwards
called the Land Records Department. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
was, I believe, an entirely original scheme, of which
the design was to keep land records and maps up to
date, year by year, so as to obviate the labour of
re-survey whenever a Settlement had to be revised.
In theory the plan was admirable; its practical
success has not been perfect, partly, I think, because
the establishment was inadequate. Mr. Smeaton
also organized and set to work the first regular
Settlement Parties in Burma. From 1887 onwards
he served as Chief Secretary, Commissioner, and
Financial Commissioner, failing, however, in the end
to attain the high office for which his rare abilities
seemed to designate him. The Chief Secretary took
over the political department, and for a time my
association with the most interesting part of the
administration was severed. I had plenty to do in
my own branches.</p>

<p>The Secretary was in charge of State prisoners, a
few of whom, members of the late reigning family of
Delhi, still survived. The ex-King, Bahadur Shah,
who had been tried and sentenced to death for his
share in the massacre of English men and women,
had been spared the extreme penalty and sent to
Rangoon, where he died in exile. His widow, the
Begam Zinath Mahal, was in Rangoon in my charge.
She and her daughter-in-law were of such exalted
rank that they were not parda-nashín<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> to English
officers. More than once I saw the old Begam who,
thirty years before, had played so lurid a part in
the Mutiny. Though now of advanced age, she
retained traces of great beauty and was specially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
proud of her finely shaped, delicate hands. Her
beauty was of the Pit, aquiline, dark, menacing.
Her son, Prince Jăwán Băkht (P. J. Băkht, as he
used quaintly to style himself on his visiting cards),
the direct representative of the Moguls, lived in
Rangoon with his wife, Shah Zamani Begam, of the
race of Nadir Shah, the Persian Conqueror. Jăwán
Băkht was not of specially marked character,
amiable and harmless. His wife was a lady of
charm and dignity, worthy of her lofty lineage. In
her youth beautiful exceedingly, time had but little
marred that lovely face. Poor lady, she was totally
blind, but the disease which had darkened her sight
left no disfigurement and hardly dimmed the lustre
of her radiant eyes. She spoke the purest Urdu, in
liquid tones sweeter than any I have ever heard in
that graceful tongue. Beyond words pathetic it
was to see and converse with this lady of a great
family, keeping to the last the pride of her race and
station, with every mark of a gentle and gracious
disposition, reduced to comparative poverty, and
sharing without a murmur the hard lot of the last
scion of a fallen dynasty. Jăwán Băkht and Shah
Zamani Begam have long been gathered to their
fathers. Their son and daughter, Mirza Jamshíd
Băkht and Ronak Begam, last of the line of Babar
and Akbar and Aurangzíb, still live in Rangoon in
receipt of miserable stipends. It is true that the
decadent Moguls did not deserve well at our hands.
Bahadur Shah and Zinath Mahal were treated even
more leniently than they merited. But their surviving
descendants are innocent of complicity in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
their crimes. Politically, they have never given
the slightest trouble; Mohammedans seem hardly
aware of their existence. Somewhat more generous
treatment might be accorded them. Their pensions
might be made sufficient to enable them to live in
reasonable comfort.</p>

<p>Another interesting State pensioner, not a
prisoner, was Prince Hassan, adopted son of Sultan
Suleiman, leader of the Panthay<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> rebellion in
Yunnan. When, finally overthrown, Suleiman died
by his own hand to avoid capture, Hassan luckily
was in Rangoon. There he stayed for the rest of
his life, in receipt of an allowance from the Indian
Government. Precisely on what grounds the grant
to Hassan of a pension from Indian revenues was
justified, I have never clearly understood. But all
who knew him must be glad that any technical
difficulties were overcome. Most charming and
courteous of men, Hassan was in some respects the
most attractive of the native notables of my acquaintance.
He spent his time quietly in study,
occasionally paying the Secretary a friendly visit.
Ronak Begam became his wife. Some years later,
after many wanderings and much tribulation, the
Panthay wife of his youth, whom he had believed
to be dead, appeared and resumed her natural
position in his house. Ronak Begam, who could
hardly be expected to take the second place, returned
to her family. Hassan died some years ago.
There are a good many Panthays in Upper Burma,
principally in Mandalay, Bhamo, Mogôk, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
Shan States, sturdy men of stalwart stature and
agreeable manners, assiduous traders, and good
citizens. With several I was on friendly terms.
My best friend among them one day brought his
very aged and wrinkled mother to see me and bade
her shake hands. The old dame obeyed, but pudically
covered her hand with a kerchief before
clasping mine.</p>

<p>For a few months in 1888 I acted as Commissioner
of the Northern Division, the second officer to hold
that appointment. Including the royal city, the
Katha district on the borders of Wuntho, the Ruby
Mines, the Kachin Hills, the China frontier, the
division has always seemed the most interesting in
the Province. To me who had been associated with
Mandalay from the beginning, the position was
specially attractive. The place was full of my
Burmese friends by whom I was cordially welcomed.
The appointment was temporary, though at first
this was not the Chief Commissioner’s intention.
As a somewhat maladroit acquaintance, meeting me
at the club on my arrival, frankly said: “Of course,
you will be here only till a senior man can be sent.”
It was true, but he need not have rubbed it in.</p>

<p>Unlike most other officers, Commissioners draw a
fixed monthly travelling allowance. It is therefore
a point of honour with them to spend a good deal of
time away from headquarters. In the Northern
Division the cost of travelling was high, and the
monthly allowance was never a source of profit. An
early tour brought me to Bhamo, after being nearly
swamped by a sudden squall. Signs of violence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
were still common. The Captain of the steamer
assured me that quite lately he had seen corpses
floating down the river “dreadfully emancipated.”
At Bhamo I was shocked to find that the day before
my arrival Bo Ti, one of the rebel leaders of Mogaung,
had escaped from the primitive wooden jail. He
was never recaptured. With him went a young
Indian who was under trial for attempting to murder
the Colonel of a native regiment. The Colonel I
found convalescent. He was a hard man, and sepoys
had often threatened to shoot him. As he was
shaving one morning he felt a shock, and knew that
he was wounded. Thinking that the threat had
been carried out, the stout old man said to himself,
“They shan’t know they have hit me,” and went on
shaving. It was really his own servant, who from
behind had slashed him with a sword. Owing to
the Colonel’s grim determination not to let the sepoy
know that he had scored, his assailant got in another
blow. This is the story as I heard it. The Colonel,
a bulky, muscular man, recovered from wounds
which would probably have killed one of slighter
build. It was doubtless by the agency of this young
Indian that the guard of the jail was corrupted and
the prisoner’s escape facilitated. He, too, made his
way to the Kachin country, and was never caught.
Vague rumours of his presence in the frontier fights
of the next few years were current. I hope he did
not have a very good time in the hills.</p>

<p>A story of Bhamo of later years may be told here.
A military police sepoy ran “amuck,” as they say.
Armed with a rifle and well supplied with ammuni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>tion,
he took possession of a masonry house, and
from a casement amused himself by shooting at
anyone who came in sight. The house was duly
surrounded by police, and the Deputy Commissioner
and District Superintendent came down. It did not
occur to them to summon infantry and guns from
the neighbouring fort, or to fire volleys at the brick
walls. The Superintendent, Mr. H. F. Hertz,<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
obtained a rough description of the interior of the
house, and entered it from next door. Groping in
the semi-darkness characteristic of native houses, he
made his way to the room next to that held by the
sepoy. Hearing a sound, the sepoy half-opened the
door and thrust out his rifle. Pushing the rifle
aside with one hand, Mr. Hertz shot the man dead
with his revolver, receiving a slight wound in the
encounter. This is the way these things are managed
in Burma.</p>

<p>Bhamo was then the headquarters of the district
which included the country bordering on China and
Tibet, all the present Myitkyina district, Mogaung,
and the Jade Mines. The column under Major
C. H. E. Adamson, which visited Mogaung and the
Jade Mines, had just returned, having secured the
submission of Kansi La and Kansi Naung, the
Kachin chiefs of the Jade Mines tract.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Soon afterwards
occurred the assault on Mogaung, gallantly
repulsed by Gurkha military police under Captain
Hugh O’Donnell<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> and Mr. Lawrence Eliott. Close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
to China, from which it is separated by a range of
hills, Bhamo is filled by a strange variety of races.
Chinese, stalwart traders of Yunnan; Panthays, survivors
of the great rebellion; Shans, Shan-Chinese,
Shan-Burmans, Kachins of many divers tribes, give
life and colour and speak a Babel of tongues in the
bazaar. Driving along one of the roads leading out
of the town, the traveller is impressed by a sign-post
bearing the legend&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">To China.</span>
</p>

<p>Not many miles away the peaks of the Kachin Hills
rise in the eastern sky. Across these hills come
caravans<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> from T’Êngyüeh (Momien) and Manwaing,
in those days paying toll to the Kachins for
leave to pass. Through these hills marched the ill-fated
Margary before he attempted his fatal return
journey. Through them in later days, with happier
omens, walked Dr. Morrison at the end of his
adventurous pilgrimage. A few miles below the
town of Bhamo the Irrawaddy runs through a
narrow, rock-bound gorge known as the Second
Defile. Conspicuous on the right bank looms the
tall Elephant Rock, crowned by a small golden
pagoda. I have had the rare experience of passing
through the defile by the light of the full moon.
The silver light on the towering crags, the silence
and the solitude, created an effect full of mystery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
and charm. Emerging from the defile, we reach the
town of Shwegu, whence, gazing on the sunset
painting with gorgeous colours the western hills,
one realizes “the incomparable pomp of eve.” Above
Bhamo the river pierces a still more gloomy, precipitous,
whirlpool-haunted gorge, the First Defile.
In the dry months, from November to April, this
defile is navigable by launches, and with reasonable
care the passage can be made without risk. In the
rains it is closed to all traffic except that of country
boats and timber rafts. Once, long ago, two gallant
officers came through in a launch as late as May.
They had no wish to repeat the experiment. When
in full flood, to traverse the defile even in a boat is
an adventure requiring nerve and skill. On the
upward course the boat is towed laboriously for
many weary days. If the rope slips, the work of
days may be lost in a few minutes. Down-stream
the journey is far more rapid and even more
hazardous. I do not think any British officer has
been drowned in the defile, but several of my friends
have lost their baggage. At least one launch lies in
its fathomless depths. At any time the passage
through the defile is full of interest and excitement.
Nothing can surpass the wild beauty of its winding,
rock-bound course. Here, in mid-stream, a sharp
boulder has to be shunned; there careful steering is
needed lest the vessel be spun round in a whirlpool;
now we seem to be driving straight against a wall
of stone. To leave Burma without traversing the
First Defile is to miss one of the sights of the
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>Another tour led me across the Shwebo district,
then in the Northern Division, where my old friend
Mr. B. K. S. MacDermott was in charge. The
township officer was Maung Tun, K.S.M., afterwards
Extra Assistant Commissioner, a local officer
of remarkable ability and of proved courage and
loyalty. His father, Bo Pyin, had been Wun of
Shwebo, and had retired at an advanced age. He
is the man already mentioned who shocked his pious
serious-minded son by retaining his passion for the
chase.</p>

<p>Here is the city of Alaungpaya; here Mindôn
Min raised the standard of revolt against his
brother. Shwebo was always a turbulent district,
the seed-bed of sedition; it retained that
character long after the annexation. At this time
it was fairly quiet; we rode through it with a
moderate escort. As we left the town we saw
approaching a long line of Burmans, in carts and
on foot, men, women, and children. “All these
people,” said the Deputy Commissioner with pride,
“are coming in to my new bazaar.” On inquiry,
we ascertained that they were really all coming in
to be vaccinated. This is an example of the good
sense and lack of prejudice so often found among
Burmans. Years before, the people of Pantanaw
had begged for a vaccinator. If proper facilities
were provided, the whole population of Burma could
be vaccinated without recourse to compulsion.
Only the inefficiency and corruption of an underpaid
staff and the untrustworthy quality of the
lymph have retarded this desirable consummation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
I am glad to say that these defects have now been,
or are in process of being, remedied.</p>

<p>From Shwebo we crossed the Katha district and
came to Kawlin on the verge of the Shan State of
Wuntho.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> This State, inconveniently situated in
the midst of regularly administered districts, was
left under its native chief till the year 1891.
Shortly before the annexation the Sawbwa, a
capable truculent man, had been transferred as
Wun to Mogaung for the purpose of suppressing a
Kachin rising. He accomplished the task with
devastating completeness. In Wuntho he was succeeded
by his son, a timid creature quite unlike the
savage swashbuckler who begot him. Vain efforts
had been made to induce the young chief to meet
our officers, Mr. Burgess himself and the Kinwun
Mingyi having visited Wuntho for the purpose
without success. Once the Sawbwa did meet
Mr. E. P. Cloney, Extra Assistant Commissioner.
The issue was unfortunate. At the conference,
owing to a misunderstanding, a tumult arose and
the Shan retainers drew their swords. Mr. Cloney’s
life would have been sacrificed but for the presence
of mind of the Sawbwa, who clasped him in his arms
and shielded him from attack. This is the solitary
occasion on which the Sawbwa showed any sign of
courage or resolution. Only once again he met a
British officer, Mr. H. F. P. Hall,<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Assistant Commissioner. Though I went to Wuntho
with only half a dozen sowars, the Sawbwa
declined the meeting and bolted to his remote
fortress at Pinlebu. When, owing to the survey of
the projected railway-line, the long-existing tension
became acute, the Sawbwa, after wantonly attacking
the adjacent districts, fled with his father to
China. The old man is dead. The son survives in
exile in Yunnan, having long ceased to be an object
of apprehension or of interest to the Burma Government.
The State of Wuntho is merged in the
Katha district.</p>

<p>From August, 1888, till the end of 1890, I acted
as Chief Secretary, Mr. C. G. Bayne being Secretary,
and in succession Mr. A. S. Fleming, Mr. F. C.
Gates,<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> and Mr. D. H. R. Twomey,<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Junior (or
Under) Secretary. These were years of abnormal
stress in the office, which was still undermanned.
The appointment of Mr. Fryer to be Financial Commissioner
afforded us some relief. But though a
good deal of his work was done in direct communication
with the Chief Commissioner, part of
the revenue business necessarily was transacted by
the Secretariat. These were my really strenuous
years. The practice of dictation to shorthand
writers was not yet in vogue; I have never acquired
the habit. Day after day, Sundays included, I did
my spell of work in office and then wrote on far
into the night at home, kept awake by coffee and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
protected from mosquitoes by Burman cheroots.
Six hours of sleep sufficed. Though I wrote rapidly,
I was not a quick worker. I dare say other men
would have done as much with less effort. Life in
the Secretariat presented few incidents which seem
worthy of record. The real work was being done
in the districts, in the Shan States, in the Chin
Hills.</p>

<p>These years witnessed the completion of the
pacification and settlement of Upper Burma, and
what may be called the resettlement of Lower
Burma. The details of the work in Upper Burma
have been described in Sir Charles Crosthwaite’s
book.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> The organization of the military and civil
police was perfected by the administrative ability of
General Stedman, the Inspector-General, who was a
tower of strength to the Government. Dacoit bands
were dispersed, their leaders captured or killed, the
rank and file in many cases allowed to surrender and
return to their homes on suitable terms. Admirable,
unobtrusive work was done by military, civil, and
police officers, who by degrees bore down opposition
and broke the forces of disorder. The most potent
instrument in the final establishment of settled administration
was the village law planned by Sir
Charles Crosthwaite himself. This invaluable enactment
created the village as the unit of administration,
and placed the village headman in a position of
authority and responsibility. He became the local
judge and magistrate, with limited but sufficient
power to enforce his orders. As far as possible the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
office was made hereditary, but the people were consulted
in the appointment. Henceforth the post,
though not one of great emolument, instead of being
avoided, was eagerly sought.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> The village law did
much more than elevate the headman. It enforced
the joint responsibility of villagers for offences committed
within their borders, for stolen property
traced to the village tract. The Deputy Commissioner
was legally empowered to require villages to
be duly fenced. All able-bodied men were bound
under penalties to turn out to resist any unlawful
attack. Above all, subject to carefully devised safeguards,
power was given to the local authorities
to order the temporary removal of persons found to
be in sympathy with outlaws. No measure was
more efficacious than this to secure the destruction
of dacoit gangs by depriving them of support and
sustenance. These are among the most important
provisions of the village law which has done more
than gun and sword to assure permanent peace.
The revenue system was formalized as far as our
limited knowledge allowed on the lines of Burmese
law and custom. Meanwhile, the border lands were
not neglected. Of the Shan States some mention
will be made presently. The Chins might have
lived unmolested in their hills, but they could not
give up their rooted habit of raiding villages in the
plains. The plundering of peaceful hamlets, the carrying
off of living captives and the heads of the slain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
provoked inevitable reprisals. Happily the policy
of slaying, burning, and scuttling was not adopted.
After laborious operations, the Chins were thoroughly
subjugated and disarmed. Military police posts
were established in their midst. They are now
peaceful and amenable to law. The names honourably
associated with the arduous task of settling
these rugged hills are those of Major F. D. Raikes,
C.I.E., General Sir W. Penn Symons, Mr. B. S.
Carey, C.I.E., Mr. D. Ross, Mr. D. J. C. Macnabb,<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
Captain F. M. Rundall,<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> Mr. E. O. Fowler, and
Mr. H. N. Tuck. Here, too, Captain Le Quesne<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
won the Victoria Cross by gallantly tending a
wounded officer under fire from a stockade. The
Kachin Hills and the State of Wuntho alone remained
for settlement in later years.</p>

<p>No detailed story of the restoration of order in
Lower Burma has yet been given to the world; nor
does it lie within the scheme of these personal
reminiscences to supply the omission. The outbreak
of disturbance at the end of 1885 has already been
mentioned. For years crime continued to be rampant.
A few figures may be given. In 1886 the
number of dacoities was 2,183; in 1887, 1,387; in
1888, 695; in 1889, 332; in 1890, 181. Serious
risings there were: one in Tavoy in 1888, quelled
by Colonel Adamson and Mr. Twomey; one in
Sandaway, sternly repressed by Mr. Bernard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Houghton, who at the outset nearly fell a victim
to the insurgents. But in the period now under
reference it was not so much a question of dealing,
as in Upper Burma, with organized resistance on a
large scale as of suppressing countless small, isolated
gangs. The strict enforcement of the Village Act,
framed on the lines indicated above, and vigorous
disarmament carried out in the face of ignorant and
factious criticism, were among the most efficient
means of restoring peace. The plan of placing a
defined area in charge of a specially selected officer
invested with large powers for the suppression of
crime was tried with excellent effect. Pyuntazá, in
Shwegyin, was reduced to order by Mr. Todd-Naylor,
to whom the Chief Commissioner gave a free hand
with abundant support. Boldest, most strenuous,
most untiring of men, traversing vast distances with
incredible speed on the scantiest fare, facing every
danger and enduring every hardship, there, and
soon afterwards in Tharrawaddy, Mr. Todd-Naylor
earned great and well-merited renown. For the
first, and so far the only, time in its history,
Tharrawaddy was at rest. In every district solid
work was done, and by degrees normal conditions
were established.</p>

<p>An event which I recall with interest was the
visit to Rangoon of the celebrated traveller, Mr.
Colborne Baber, of the China Consular Service,
deputed to Burma in connection with the proposed
demarcation of the Chinese boundary. Baber was
one of the elect of travellers. Not only did he make
hazardous and scientifically important journeys, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
he also had the gift of letters, so that his records
have a place in literature. A man of genius, a born
explorer, of various and versatile accomplishments,
he was, I believe, a sinologist of distinction, and
certainly a scholar of no mean attainment. Before
proceeding to Bhamo to study the boundary question
on the spot, he was our guest for some days in
Rangoon. These are days of happy memory, made
bright by his luminous and inspiring talk, his distinguished
and attractive personality. He seemed to
live principally on cigarettes, and cared too little
for a body not physically strong. Early in 1890 he
died at Bhamo, mainly from weakness caused by his
own neglect of material comfort. His premature
death was a loss to the State, and a lasting grief to
his friends.</p>

<p>More than once in these two years I visited
Mandalay in attendance on the Chief Commissioner,
sometimes occupying my old quarters in the Palace,
sometimes enjoying the hospitality of Government
House. One trivial incident illustrates the state of
the country even close to the capital of Upper
Burma. Rather late one night a friend<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> called me
out of my quarters to go to see a fire. Having seen
as many fires as would satisfy the most morbid
craving, I cannot think why this fire attracted me.
However, we went. As usual, the scene was much
farther off than we thought. Passing out of the
city gate, we walked for some miles across the fields
till we came at last to a village where houses were
still blazing. It had been plundered and burnt by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
Bo To, the most prominent leader then afoot in the
district. The police were there before us, and the
dacoits had disappeared. As we were alone, armed
only with walking-sticks, perhaps it was lucky that
we did not arrive an hour or two sooner.</p>

<p>The last day of February, 1889, saw the formal
opening of the railway from Toungoo to Mandalay.
The occasion was celebrated with some pomp, Sir
Charles Eliott,<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> K.C.S.I., Public Works Member,
representing the Government of India. Later in the
year, during the absence of Sir Charles Crosthwaite
on privilege leave for three months, Mr. A. P. MacDonnell,<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
Home Secretary to the Government of
India, acted as Chief Commissioner. Mr. MacDonnell
was, of course, innocent of any knowledge of the
country or the people. I doubt whether this brief
interlude of administering a strange Province could
have been a satisfactory experience to him. I am
under the impression that the Chief Secretary’s work
was materially increased.</p>

<p>At the end of 1889 Burma was honoured by the
visit of His Royal Highness Prince Albert Victor of
Wales (the late Duke of Clarence), who spent some
days in Rangoon and Mandalay. The Royal visit
was highly appreciated by the Burmese, as well as
by the European community, and was celebrated
with much demonstration of genuine spontaneous
loyalty. Chief of His Royal Highness’s staff was
the late Sir Edward Bradford, whose high qualities
it were superfluous to praise.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
A VISIT TO THE SHAN STATES</h2>

<p>The Shan States occupy the whole of the eastern
side of Upper Burma, and border on French Indo-China,
China, and Siam. It is sometimes erroneously
supposed that they are independent or semi-independent
States, on the same footing as native
States in India. From Theinni in the north to
Mobye in the south, from the Myelat in the west
to Kyaingtôn in the far east, these States were an
integral part of the Burmese kingdom, over which
the Burmese assertion of sovereignty was never
abandoned or successfully resisted. Burmese Residents
and garrisons were maintained. Though there
were rebellions, revolts, and massacres, though in
King Thebaw’s time the bonds of authority were
loosened, independence was never established. Each
State was administered by its own chief, Sawbwa,
Myosa, or Ngwekunhmu, appointed or recognized
by the Burmese Government, and very practically
subject to the King and his Council. Consequently,
when we succeeded to the sovereignty of Burma, the
Shan States became as much an integral part of
British India as any district of Upper Burma. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
speak of the annexation of a Shan State is incorrect.
Those States, such as Wuntho and Kale, which
have ceased to be governed by their own chiefs,
have been, not annexed, but taken under direct
administration. The distinction between the Shan
States and the rest of Burma is one not of political
status, but of administrative method. The Legislative
Councils of India and Burma make laws for
the Shan States as for other parts of the Province.
This power was exercised as long ago as 1886 in the
first Statute relating to Upper Burma. The principle
has been consistently maintained. The States
which are really semi-independent, subject to suzerainty,
are those of Karenni. The historical explanation
is that before we took Upper Burma we
strenuously maintained that Karenni was not part
of the King’s dominions. When we succeeded to
the King’s rights, we could not decently assert the
contrary. But though there is a theoretical distinction,
in practice Karenni is as much under control
as the Shan States.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="caption smcap">Pagoda at Monè.</p>
</div>

<p>In less than a year from the proclamation which
incorporated Upper Burma in the Empire, surely
as speedily as could be expected, an expedition was
despatched to assert our authority in the Shan
country. Colonel Stedman<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> was in command, with
Mr. A. H. Hildebrand<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> and Mr. J. G. Scott<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> as
civil officers. A full account of the operations of
the expedition has been given by Sir Charles Crosth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>waite.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
I need not attempt to tell again the tale
of Mr. Hildebrand’s conspicuous success: how he
traversed the States, receiving the submission of the
Chiefs and confirming them in their offices; how by
tact and firmness, almost without striking a blow,
he imposed peace on this distracted country; how
he became the friend and monitor, as well as the
strict supervisor, of every Chief. Nor must I yield
to the temptation to recount once more the story of
Mr. Scott’s gallant feat of arms in the capture of
Twet Nga Lu, or of his later even more splendid
display of the courage which dares the impossible
when, with a handful of Gurkhas, he brought to his
knees in his own capital the chief of Kyaingtôn,
the largest and most secluded of the States. Are
not these things written in the book so often quoted
in these pages? It is a far cry to the Shan country
and across the Salween, or these tales would be as
familiar to Britons as any tale of chivalry.</p>

<p>Mr. Hildebrand became the first Superintendent
of the Shan States. A little later they were divided
into two groups, Northern and Southern, under two
mutually independent Superintendents working in
direct communication with Government. The Shan
States extend over an area estimated at about
60,000 square miles. Here, as elsewhere in Burma,
our aim has been to administer as far as possible in
accordance with pre-existing custom. Each State
is ruled by its own Chief, who has the power of
life and death, appoints his own officials, and manages
his own finances and domestic affairs. The Chiefs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
administer their own customary law, subject to the
provisions of a very simple code, probably the
shortest since the Decalogue, which lays down a few
general principles and prohibitions. Issued in 1890,
it still remains unaltered. The Chief is appointed
by Government, and receives a sanad, or order of
appointment, defining his functions and limitations.
He is under the control of the Superintendent, and,
to a less degree, of the Assistant Superintendents in
charge of subdivisions, into which the States are
distributed. These officers have by law extensive
powers of intervention and revision, but as far as
possible they abstain from active interference in the
economy of the State. So, too, Government ordinarily
avoids exertion of direct authority, but, if
occasion requires, does not hesitate to deprive a
chief of part of his powers, to change the order of
succession, to amalgamate adjacent territories, to
alter boundaries, even, as an extreme measure, to
take a State under direct administration. All receipts
from forests and minerals belong to the general
revenues of the Province, rights over forests and
mines being reserved by Government. Subject to
this reservation, Government levies no taxes on the
people. Each State pays a fixed sum annually as
tribute, the assessment being revised every ten
years. The demand is moderate, and at the decennial
revision pleas for reduction are indulgently
considered. It need hardly be said that the chiefs
are required to keep the peace among themselves.
They are responsible for the good order of their
territories, and maintain their own local police in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
picturesque uniforms. There is also a small body of
regular police under the civil officers. The garrison
consisted at first of troops, then of military police,
then partly of troops and military police, now again
of military police alone. Each group, the Southern
and the Northern, has its own battalion. Such,
briefly and in outline, is the way in which the Shan
States were governed five-and-twenty years ago;
such is the way in which they are governed now.
Probably no dependency of so great an extent is
administered so inexpensively or with so little display
of force. As a study in administration the
experiment is full of interest, and has been remarkably
successful. In five-and-twenty years there have
naturally been changes and improvements. At first
the Chiefs lived for themselves, caring only for their
own ease and comfort, while, as was graphically
said, “the bloodsuckers around them were making
hay.” Now they are becoming more enlightened,
and beginning to realize their responsibilities. They
are learned in the mysteries of budgets and taxation
rolls. Some take a zealous interest in road-making,
in digging canals, in promoting the growth of new
staples, in sanitation and medical relief. Many of
the Chiefs are courteous and intelligent gentlemen,
who live on terms of easy friendship with British
officers. Several have visited India, more are
familiar with Rangoon and Mandalay. One Chief,
formerly very shy and reserved, now gallops on our
polo-grounds. His ambition was to visit Rangoon
periodically for the purpose of gazing on the ball-room
at Government House, which reminded him of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Heaven. When all is said, it must be remembered
that the chiefs are merely officers of Government of
no very high position, like other officers, holding
their appointments during good behaviour.</p>

<p>The Shans,<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> remnants of the race which once
dominated a vast empire in Eastern Asia, including
the whole of Northern Burma to the confines of
Tibet, are now somewhat backward in civilization.
A clannish folk, with the cohesion lacking among
Burmans. If you get hold of the chief you secure
his people also. This no doubt facilitated the task
of settlement. Of fierce appearance, to us they
seem unwarlike. Once at least a conflict was
stopped by a British officer adopting the simple
expedient of pitching his camp midway between two
hostile armies. But before our coming internecine
feuds raged savage and devastating. Like medieval
barons, Chief warred against Chief, laying waste the
country. Populous cities reduced to ruinous heaps
gave place to miserable hamlets. Wide stretches of
fertile land, thrown out of cultivation, became
deserts of jungle and tall grass where the tiger
made his lair and the elephant ranged at will.
Under the firm and just rule which we have substituted
for the intermittent ferocity of Burmese
dominion, the Shan plateau is reviving, and once
more promises to be an orchard and a harvest-field.
Scantiness of population and distance from markets
alone retard the cultivation of wheat, vegetables,
and fruit. Now a railway to the Southern States is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
being made. If it is not stopped in mid-air, and if
no parsimonious schemes hinder through communication,
an era of prosperity for the Shan country is at

<p>Early in 1890, I accompanied Sir Charles Crosthwaite
on the first visit paid by a Chief Commissioner
to the Southern Shan States. We rode from the
railway at Meiktila road (Thazi), past Hlaingdet, up
and along the customary mule-track to Kalaw, on
the border of the Myelat<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> plain. The cart-road
was yet unmade. There was not a cart of any kind
in the Shan country. Kalaw lies in the midst of
pine-forests, a perfectly lovely spot, believed by
many to be the future hill-capital of Burma. It
will be an important station on the new railway.
Personally, I doubt whether it will displace Maymy̆o,
though it may well be to Maymy̆o what
Mussoorie is to Simla. From Kalaw we rode
through the Myelat, fine open country, but intersected
by many ravines, to Nyaungywe, on the edge
of the Inle Lake. The chiefs of the Myelat States
flocked to meet the head of the Province, and with
bands of wild retainers, with much clashing of
cymbals and beating of gongs, escorted him on his
march. Crossing the lake we came to Fort Stedman,
then the civil and military headquarters. Here the
Chief Commissioner halted for some days, interviewing
local officers and many Shan notables, and
holding a Durbar, at which he addressed the
assembled Chiefs. These State visits to Fort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
Stedman and Taung-gyi, which afterwards became
the Superintendent’s headquarters, were full of
interest, certainly to the visitors, probably also to
the local inhabitants. I have assisted at three such
visits. From distant hills, from far across the
Salween, come multitudes of strange people eager to
do honour to the representative of their Sovereign.
Weird dances by outlandish folk, grotesque caperings
some, others slow melancholy measures, expressed
the popular rejoicing. The lake was alive
with boats competing in exciting races. Men and
women took part in these contests. Here you
might see the Sawbwa distribute prizes to victors
and vanquished, these races being of the nature of a
caucus-race, and smearing with lime the foreheads
of the losers. You shall also see the lake-dwellers
standing and rowing with legs instead of arms, a
difficult and, as one may think, somewhat useless
feat. Many young and ambitious officers have
sought to accomplish it, but in vain. The lake-men
row in this way with perfect ease and skill, but not,
I think, faster than a boat paddled in the ordinary
style.</p>

</div>

<p>Fort Stedman is well situated in the State of
Nyaungywe, one of the largest and most prosperous
of the Southern States. At the time of the annexation,
the Sawbwa was Saw Maung, a man of culture
and education, trained at the Court of Mandalay in
all the learning of the Burmans. Soon after, his
cousin Chit Su rebelled against him. In the first
fight Saw Maung was severely wounded, being shot
through both thighs. Very confidingly, he placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
his troops and arms at the disposal of his brother,
Saw Ôn, who offered to suppress the revolt. Having
done this effectually, occupied the capital, and tasted
the sweets of power, Saw Ôn declined to make way
for the rightful Chief. Forced to retire, Saw Maung
with a small following established himself on the
borders of the Myelat. Thence, anxious to prevent
more fighting, Government summoned him to
Mandalay and directed him to stay there in receipt
of an allowance. In the Shan States, as elsewhere,
our policy was to accept existing facts. If the Chief
in actual possession was willing to submit, he was
confirmed in his office. When Mr. Hildebrand came
to Nyaungywe, he was warmly welcomed by Saw
Ôn, whom he rescued from a position of much peril.
Saw Ôn, therefore, was recognized as Sawbwa and
held charge till his death some years later. He was
the chief whom Sir Charles Crosthwaite found in
Nyaungywe, a boisterous uncivilized person, with
some sense of humour, whose loud laugh concealed a
mind by no means vacant of ability and cunning.
At his death, Saw Maung<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> was restored to his
State. He proved an excellent ruler, probably the
most enlightened and progressive of the Shan chiefs,
full of projects for the good of his people, and exceedingly
popular with all classes. Though in the
early days after his return the lake-men were ready
to rebel against him, not many years later, when
Their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of
Wales visited Mandalay, Saw Maung sat in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
boat of the leg-paddlers competing in a race on the
moat.</p>

<p>From Fort Stedman we returned by the way we
came, the Chief Commissioner for my sake considerately
riding the last three marches in one day.
According to the original programme, if we had
missed the train I should have missed also the
steamer which was to take me home on my first
leave. I caught the steamer and enjoyed the leave,
which lasted a few days over three months. I cannot
say that I enjoyed the return journey from
Calcutta in the middle of the monsoon, seeing no
sun nor star, in a boat on which cockroaches of
gigantic stature vied with myriads of red ants in
making life hideous.</p>

<p>I remained in Rangoon as Chief Secretary till the
end of the year, when the Secretariat was reorganized
and strengthened. Mr. Symes came back
as Chief Secretary. I was appointed to be a
Divisional Commissioner, but was seconded for duty
as a Secretary till I went on furlough early in 1891.
Mr. Mackenzie<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> became Chief Commissioner, Sir
Charles Crosthwaite going to Council. The work of
pacification and organization was completed. Conscious
of a great trust worthily discharged, the most
eminent of Burma’s rulers moved on to fresh fields of
action, less thrilling but not less honourable.</p>

RANGOON&mdash;MANDALAY</h2>

<p>When I returned early in 1893, Mr. Fryer was
acting as Chief Commissioner during Sir Alexander
Mackenzie’s absence on leave; Mr. Symes was still
Chief Secretary. For a few weeks I was on special
duty examining and abstracting the documentary
evidence concerning the boundary between Burma
and China, then in the acute stage of discussion
between the two Governments. After this was done,
for a short time I held charge of the Pegu division.
It was a most unsatisfactory appointment. The
Commissioner was still Sessions Judge, and, though
assisted by a coadjutor, took a full share of the
original and appellate work. Piled on top of the
revenue and administrative duties, this formed a
mountain which no one could scale. However
strenuously the Commissioner laboured, however
much he accomplished, he felt that as much or more
remained undone. This was worse than the Secretariat,
where, with diligence, one could keep abreast
of the files.</p>

<p>The one exciting incident of my brief tenure of
this office was the riot in Rangoon between Moham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>medans
and Hindus in June, 1893. In Burma we
were accustomed to a mild and tolerant religion, and
had little acquaintance with the fierce fanaticism of
warring sects. We resented bitterly the stirring up
of strife by Mohammedans and Hindus in a land
where they were strangers and pilgrims, hospitably
received and treated with courtesy and consideration.
Just as if guests should hurl decanters at one
another across their host’s dinner-table. It is not
quite accurate to say that Burmans dislike and
despise Indians. They welcome them with large-hearted
tolerance, and live amicably side by side
with them. But the Burman regards himself as a
superior being, much superior to anyone, except,
perhaps, even this is doubtful, a European. And
he does resent Indians being placed in authority
over him.</p>

<p>The occasion of this unusual and unnecessary
tumult was the Mohammedan festival of Bakr-i-id.
Though in Burma we have, I think, a slight leaning
to the side of Mohammedans, whose religion is less
puzzling to the lay mind than the abstruse mythology
of the Hindus, I am bound to say that this
time the Mohammedans were entirely in the wrong.
In Twenty-ninth Street, a narrow thoroughfare of
no good name, stood a Hindu temple of some repute.
Having the rest of Rangoon practically at their disposal,
the Mohammedans declared it essential to
sacrifice their cow close to this temple. Forbidden
by the magistrate to do this, it was expected that
they would set at naught the prohibition. Such
precautions as seemed necessary were taken by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
Deputy Commissioner, Mr. A. S. Fleming, who was
in close communication with me and with the Chief
Secretary, Mr. Fryer being absent on tour. We
determined to do the best with the police before
calling out troops. Military and civil police patrols
were organized; and early on Sunday morning, the
great day of the feast, a fairly strong picket of
military police, partly Mohammedans and partly
Hindus, was posted at the top of Twenty-ninth
Street. All local and civil officers, as well as others
not immediately concerned, were in the town. The
streets were thronged with people, Mohammedans
in holiday attire, Hindus ready to make mischief,
both sides spoiling for a fight. From the top of
Twenty-ninth Street could be seen the great mosque
in Mogul Street, crowded with excited worshippers.
For a time, though the tension was extreme, nothing
happened. One high official, who was present as a
sightseer, asked wherefore the rioting did not begin.
Before long he was satisfied. The crowd became a
seething mass. A rush was made to force the
picket holding Twenty-ninth Street. Then stones
began to fly, and all was confusion. Sowars<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> cleared
the street, but as soon as the charge was past the
roadway was again filled with rioters. Mr. Fleming
had his head cut open by a stone. My thick topi<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
saved me from a similar mishap, and I was struck
by missiles more than once. The spot near the
objective of strife, where several of us were standing,
became a very warm corner. It seemed advisable to
summon troops. My friend Mr. E. W. B. Summers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
volunteered to ride up to barracks, running the
gauntlet of showers of stones from street and houses.
That shots were fired from windows was said, but
this is not within my knowledge. At last it became
clear that the small party of police and officials at
the top of Twenty-ninth Street was in imminent
danger of being wiped out. I therefore told the
senior military police officer to take the necessary
measures to stop the riot. A file of men was ordered
out, and a volley was fired, causing some loss of life.
As if by magic, the uproar ceased in a moment. At
first, by my order, blank cartridge was fired, but
without effect. It has since been definitely ordered
that on these occasions blank cartridge is never to
be used. I dare say I am wrong. Certainly the
weight of authority is against me. But if I used
my own judgment, in a similar emergency, as a
measure of humanity, I should again try first the
effect of blank firing. The statement made at the
time that blank fire only infuriated the mob is quite
baseless. It had no effect whatever. By the time
the troops arrived all was quiet. The soldiers
marched through the streets and were picketed in
the town, and there was no further disorder.</p>

<p>This is the story of the riot of 1893 as pictured in
my memory. Yet such is the fallibility of human
testimony that accounts written immediately afterwards
by myself and two other officers, all close
together at the time, differed on material points.
This was a useful lesson to me in dealing with the
evidence of eye-witnesses, especially in times of
excitement. Defects of observation and lapses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
memory cause discrepancies in the stories of witnesses
whose sole desire is to tell the truth. The
stern suppression of this wicked and wanton riot
kept the peace in Rangoon for twenty years. At
first, as Bakr-i-id came round, troops were posted in
the town. But there has been no disturbance, and
display of military force has been discontinued. I
do not think Indians bore me any ill-will for the
part taken by me in this affair. To the end of my
service many of them remained my good friends.
Within a couple of months of the riot my wife and
I were welcomed at the Mohurram in Mandalay,
listened to the sad story of Hassan and Hussein,
and watched the fiery rites of that impressive
celebration.</p>

<p>In the middle of 1893 I became Commissioner of
the Northern Division. The country was perfectly
quiet and in order. Settled times had succeeded
the bustle and confusion of the pacification. There
was now leisure to prepare and execute projects for
the benefit of the people. First among these was
the Mu Valley Railway, which runs from Sagaing
to Myit-kyina, opening up the fertile, land-locked
plains of Wuntho, where a year or two earlier
unhusked rice sold for ten rupees a hundred baskets,
and rich lands farther north. A branch runs to
Katha, on the Irrawaddy, below Bhamo, with which
there is connection by ferry. Between Mandalay
and Sagaing there is still a gap in the system. As
soon as funds are available the Irrawaddy must be
bridged, and through communication established
from Rangoon to Myit-kyina. Even more important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
than the railway were two great irrigation schemes
for watering the dry districts of Mandalay and
Shwebo. These were being examined and matured.
When I rode through Shwebo in the autumn of this
year with the Deputy Commissioner, Mr. G. W.
Shaw,<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> the fields were as hard as the stony-hearted
pavement of Oxford Street. Anxiously the people
watched the sky, longing for the appearance of the
smallest cloud. Rice was scarce, and edible roots
formed the staple fare of the peasantry. We were
perilously near the Famine Code. In those days, if
Shwebo had one good year in three, it reckoned
itself fortunate. Luckily, at harvest-time there was
always work in Lower Burma; and if the season
failed, crowds streamed down to the teeming rice-fields
of the Delta, whence they honourably remitted
sustenance for the women, the aged, and the infirm
left in their homes. Though emigration is easy and
common enough, most Burmans are strongly attached
to their birthplace, and cling with passionate affection
to their ancestral lands. Mortgages are kept
alive for a century or more, the hope of regaining
possession being abandoned with extreme reluctance.
Thus, though many farmers from the sterile north
took up land in the Delta and made new homes, the
majority hastened back to their native districts at
the faintest prospect of a good season. Now in
Shwebo, thanks to the Irrigation Canal, the face of
the country is changed. Thousands of acres formerly
dependent on precarious rainfall receive ample and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
regular supplies of water, and are under continuous
cultivation. The pretty song of the women as they
plant out the seedlings from the pyogin<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> is doubtless
heard as of yore, now not intermittently, but
each year as the season recurs. A District which
was too often a barren waste is now a rich harvest-field,
giving grain not only for local use, but for
export. Similar good results have been obtained
in the Mandalay district by similar means. These
irrigation systems, which not only enrich the people,
but also yield a handsome revenue, were planned
and executed with all the skill and science of irrigation
engineers experienced in such work in the
Punjab. They were based on the old Burmese
works, which had fallen into disrepair, and which at
no time were sufficiently well planned and managed
to secure regular crops.</p>

<p>On the borders, the Kachins had been reduced to
order and had become for the most part a law-abiding
people. No longer were they permitted to
levy toll on passing caravans, or to raid and oppress
the plain villages at the foot of their hills. Their
subjugation had not been effected without difficulty.
In 1891 and 1892 there was severe fighting at Sima
and Sadôn; and as recently as Christmas, 1892,
Myitkyina had been attacked and burnt by a raiding
party from the north. But when they had been
well beaten, and when posts had been established at
various points, the hillmen rapidly settled down.
The discontinuance of their lawless practices was
more than compensated by the wealth acquired as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
payment for services rendered to our officers and
military police garrisons. The Kachins, in which
name may be included, conveniently if unscientifically,
many kindred tribes speaking different dialects
and following diverse customs, are sturdy fellows,
peopling the hills of the Bhamo district, on the
borders of China and Tibet. As a race, they have
the vigour and vitality characteristic of mountaineers.
They are distinctly one of the most progressive races
of Burma, and, but for our advent, would have
penetrated gradually far into the plains of Burma
and the Shan States. Washed and brushed up,
many Kachins show signs of a high order of intelligence.</p>

<p>At this time the Bhamo district still included all
the Kachin country, Myitkyina not being yet constituted
a separate charge. Mainly by the genius
of Mr. E. C. S. George,<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> the system of managing
the tribesmen was evolved. The hills were divided
into administered and unadministered tracts. In
the latter there were no posts, and no interference
was attempted. So long as their inhabitants
abstained from raids and outrages in the settled
country; so long, as was somewhat crudely said, as
they confined their zeal for slaughter to their own
borders, they were at liberty to do as they pleased.
No officers visited them, summoned them to appear,
or exacted any tax or tribute. Travellers crossed
the administrative line at their own risk, Government
accepting no responsibility for their safety, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
refusing to exact reparation if they suffered wrong.
Our sovereignty over these tracts was not abandoned;
it was merely left in abeyance. From time to time
the administrative line has been varied. On this
side of the line Government undertook to preserve
order and to punish misconduct. The administered
country was dominated by police posts and placed
in charge of the Deputy Commissioner and his
assistants. Control light but effective was enforced.
A simple code was promulgated, care being taken to
avoid the creation of artificial offences and undue
interference with local customs. Each village-tract
had its own headman, with fairly extensive powers,
appointed by the Deputy Commissioner. In early
days the headman was rather absurdly called
Sawbwa; with fuller knowledge the title of Duwa
was adopted. Periodically in the open season, the
Deputy Commission and his Assistants, with suitable
escorts, made set tours through the hills, trying
cases, settling disputes, and collecting the moderate
tribute or household tax, the only revenue raised
from the Kachins. This patriarchal system, which
was gradually perfected, has succeeded admirably.
Since the beginning of 1893, only one serious
disturbance<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> has broken the peace of the Kachin
country. The orderly condition of our hill-tracts
afforded a pleasing contrast to the state of those
close at hand under Chinese control, where complete
indifference alternated with savage measures of
repression.</p>

<p>Affairs on the Chinese border gave some trouble.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
The boundary had been declared, but not yet demarcated.
Its actual location being still undetermined,
it was difficult to prevent encroachments,
some of which were designed to strengthen the
Chinese case when the border-line came to be
settled. We had to correspond directly with
Chinese officers at Yunnan-fu and T’Êngyüeh, consular
officers at these places not having yet been
appointed. On the whole, the Chinese were not
bad neighbours. We certainly were not afraid of
them, but were able to take a correct measure of
their power as of their diplomacy.</p>

<p>At the end of the year 1893, just at the close of
his turn of office, the Viceroy, Lord Lansdowne,
came to Burma. With Lady Lansdowne, he visited
Mandalay, went up the river as far as Bhamo, and
by launch through the First Defile to Sinbo. In His
Excellency’s party were Sir Henry Brackenbury,<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
Military Member of Council; Sir John Ardagh,
Private Secretary; Mr. W. J. Cuningham,<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Foreign
Secretary; and once more Lord William Beresford
as Military Secretary. The administration of the
Kachin Hills and the Chinese boundary was discussed
on the spot by the Viceroy with the Chief
Commissioner and his local officers. At Bhamo the
Viceroy held a Durbar on the house-boat in which
the Chief Commissioner was wont to travel in comfort,
if not in luxury. Kachin Duwas came in
crowds and laid spears and elephant tusks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
embroidered cloths at His Excellency’s feet, receiving
more valuable gifts in return. On shore weird
Kachin dances were performed mid unseasonable
rain, which damped the revels. It was a pity, for at
the best a Kachin dance is a depressing ceremony,
something like “Here we go round the mulberry
bush,” played by tired children. At Mandalay, in
the golden-pillared Western Hall of Audience, a fitting
setting for so brilliant a scene, another Durbar
was held, glittering with uniforms of British officers
and gay with the bright Court dresses of Burman
and Shan notables.</p>

<p>This cold season I toured in the hills for some
weeks and in the pleasantest company. Captain
Bower,<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> having covered himself with glory by hunting
down the murderer of Dalgleish and earned
fresh laurels by his adventurous march across Tibet,
came over to gather honey for the Intelligence hive.
Mr. George, who made all the bandobast<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> for the
tour, was more at home among Kachins than any
man of his time. Starting from Waing-maw, we
marched inland to Sima, the scene of a fierce
struggle not many months before, where Morton met
a soldier’s death and Captain Lloyd<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> won the
Victoria Cross. So close to the border that in the
first Boundary Convention, concluded when our
diplomatists were in great awe of China’s puissance,
it was assigned to our neighbours, Sima was a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
outpost in the hills. Surrounded by a stockade, a
ditch, and barbed-wire entanglements, it was strong
enough to resist any probable attack. Officers and
men were housed in huts of mud or mat, stores and
ammunition in sheds of corrugated iron. Long since
these primitive posts have been replaced by substantial
forts built on scientific plans. A line of
them holds the frontier and dominates the hills.
From Sima we struck northward to Sadôn, then our
farthest outpost. We strolled at leisure; along
forest paths up and down hill; across clear mountain-streams,
sometimes at a ford, sometimes by a swaying
bridge hastily made of bamboos with a carpet of
long grass, sometimes on a raft or rude dugout;
through thriving Kachin villages perched on crests
of hills, where the barbarous people showed us no
little kindness, offering fruits from their Taungyas<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
and encouraging us to explore their long, low
thatched houses. A stretch of the march led easily
over the saddle of a range of hills. In the morning
the valleys were covered with a veil of mist; as
this dispersed, at our feet were spread fertile plains,
and in the distance gleamed the Irrawaddy like a
silver thread. Our escort was a score of mounted
military police, our transport mules from China.
Early, but not too early, we rose and took a substantial
chota haziri<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> beside the camp-fire while the
mules were loading up. Chinese muleteers have
many good points, but they need handling, and submit
with reluctance to interference with their little
ways. You may hearken, but their voice is not in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
heaven before the lark. Even when they have been
roused from slumber, it is any odds that two or
three mules have wandered off in the night and
have to be sought with vituperation best left
obscure. The actual loading is comparatively
simple. The baggage is tied to a wooden saddle
which is lifted on to the mule’s back and left there
unfastened. At that season, at the height of some
three or four thousand feet, the climate was perfect,
cool, and bright. We could march all day without
inconvenience. Once started, we walked and rode,
staying now and then to interview headmen and
villagers with special reference to an inquiry into
the opium habit which I was making for my own
satisfaction, till we reached our halting-place, on the
bank of a crystal stream. One inviolable rule was
enforced. The sumpter mule always headed the
cavalcade. After a dip in the river, while tents
were being pitched we breakfasted under a shady
tree at any hour from one to five, as the length of
the march determined. The best servant in the
camp was Captain Bower’s Pathan, a hook-nosed
ruffian from the North-West Frontier, who had been
in every scrap on the border for a generation.
When he raised his finger, the other servants fled
gibbering. After dinner, the day’s work over, he
relaxed. In a leafy bower, like a figure from the
Arabian Nights, smoking a hookah he sat holding
enthralled a breathless audience with, one fondly
hoped, stories of adventure. Perhaps he was only
discussing prices in the bazaar. Next to him, <i>longo
intervallo</i>, was the Kachin Zinaw who acted as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>terpreter
and handyman. He began the march
speaking Chinese, Shan, Burmese, and several
Kachin dialects; he ended with a working knowledge
of English and Hindustani. Zinaw was a man
of great intelligence, but not of lofty principle.
For negotiating the passage of a rushing stream,
or for hastily rigging up a camp, he was invaluable.
Some years he flourished, till misdirected ingenuity
brought him to grief. His last service
to Government was rendered, I believe, in the
Bhamo Jail.</p>

<p>Up to Sadôn we climbed with labour and heavy
sorrow, each height surmounted revealing our goal
apparently as distant as ever, till we were fain to
sit down in the dust and weep. Drever, the post
commandant, an athlete of renown, explained the
special advantage of life at Sadôn. Whenever you
went for a walk you had to descend 2,000 feet
and climb up again. So you kept in condition.
In posts like this one or two civil and military
police officers spent the months guarding the
marches. Occasional tours were welcome interludes.
The work was not very arduous, and there was a
blessed lack of files and records. But it was a hard
life, with few amenities, often drearily monotonous.
Our frontier officers cheerfully endured this isolated
existence, and kept bright their country’s honour
among the hill tribes.</p>

<p>Still passing northward, we reached the bank of
the ’Nmaikha, the main branch of the Irrawaddy,
which, starting from a source still unascertained,
joins the Mali-kha some thirty miles above Myit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>kyina.
We camped at ’Nsentaru Ferry, forbidden
to cross, as the <i>enclave</i> between the two rivers is
unadministered territory. A scene of savage beauty,
with hills on every side, the distant peaks on the
Chinese border white with snow. We rambled upstream
and along the bank of the ’Nmaikha, farther
than any of our officers had yet penetrated.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
Returning to camp at midday, we bathed in the
ice-cold water of the river, fresh from the snowy
hills.</p>

<p>From ’Nsentaru we marched through Kwitu and
across the Irrawaddy to Myitkyina, then the headquarters
of a subdivision. It was but a small
village, with very humble public buildings, well
placed on a high bank of the river, whose waters
flowed clear as crystal. Now it is the terminus of
the railway, a flourishing town, with many Indian
settlers, the resort of fishermen who catch mahseer
of ever-increasing weight. We rode to the confluence
where the ’Nmaikha and Mali-kha join to form
the Irrawaddy, more than a thousand miles from the
sea; a very picturesque spot, with the mountain-streams
rushing and tumbling over rocks and
boulders. We returned on rafts, and were privileged
to shoot the rapids which impede the navigation
of the river above Myitkyina. They are not
much to boast of as rapids, but the raftsmen made
a fat fuss, shouting and hustling as we toiled
through the eddies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>From Myitkyina we rode inland to Mogaung, a
singularly unpleasant town, important as a trading
centre. In the regions north-west of Mogaung
comes almost all the jade yet discovered; the rest
is found in Turkestan. Though lovely and ornamental,
jade is not classed as a precious stone, and
has little vogue in Europe except for hilts of daggers
in ladies’ novels. Chinese merchants have a practical
monopoly, and most of the stone goes to China,
where it is properly appreciated by a nation of
artistic taste. The right of levying <i>ad valorem</i> duty
on all jade brought to Mogaung is farmed out by
Government. As the value of a piece of jade in the
rough cannot be determined accurately, the business
of dealing and of farming is distinctly speculative.
The value is revealed by cutting; the duty is paid
on uncut stones. The farmer assesses the duty on
any piece of stone brought in. The owner has the
option of either paying the duty or selling it to the
farmer at the farmer’s valuation. This plan insures
fair dealing on both sides. But there is always the
attractive element of chance. Except for the jade
business and some historic associations, Mogaung
was a dull and uninteresting place. Our objective
was the lovely lake of Indawgyi, which I was not
to see till nearly twenty years after.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>Sudden news came of a Kachin rising on the
eastern frontier. The escort of a civil officer had
been attacked, and had suffered some loss. The
border might be ablaze. The Deputy Commissioner
must hasten to the spot; nor could the Commis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>sioner
remain unconcerned. We rode to Sinbo next
day, covering nearly fifty miles on one pony apiece,
carrying no kit and taking no attendants, our rations
in our saddle-bags. At Sinbo we found a launch
and all necessary comforts provided by Mr. George’s
forethought. Next day, as soon as the morning
mist had lifted, the launch started, and in two
minutes was fast on a sandbank. Not all the
labours of the villagers, who turned out <i>en masse</i>,
availed to move it a foot. Resolved to reach Bhamo
that day, we took a small boat and began the
passage of the Defile. It was plain paddling with
the stream, but parlous slow, and hot and cramped.
When we were about half-way through, our luck
changed. We met a Government launch, which we
boarded and turned about. So at sundown we
landed at Bhamo. Half an hour later the launch
abandoned at Sinbo also arrived.</p>

<p>Next morning we set out for the frontier. Riding
most of the day and night, stumbling after dark on
narrow ridges<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> between rice-fields, at about midnight
we came into camp, not without some slight
risk of being shot by a zealous sentry. All escorts
within range having been bidden by telegraph and
signal to combine, quite a considerable force of
military police and a dozen British officers were
assembled. It was as if the Deputy Commissioner,
fulfilling Pompey’s thrasonical boast, had stamped
upon the ground and raised legions. This sudden
show of strength, coupled with Mr. George’s tact
and management, speedily restored peace. Leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
him to distribute rewards and penalties, I rode back
with a tin of bully beef for sustenance, and a couple
of sowars as escort. On the way I slept at the
Kachin village of Pônkan, where I was hospitably
entertained by the Duwa, who not many years
before had literally held Bhamo in terror. He was
a tall and handsome savage, but somewhat given to
drink. At Bhamo I spent the next hundred hours
in making up six weeks’ arrears of office-work. Then
I took a day’s rest.</p>

<p>This was my best tour. But all the travelling in
the Northern Division was full of interest. Mogôk
and the Ruby Mines provided an agreeable interlude.
Katha, a pestilential district in the rains, was perfect
marching ground in the dry season. Wuntho,
but lately brought into line, was revisited, and
Piulebu, on the bank of the Mu River, once the
Sawbwa’s strong place of refuge, inspected. With
me rode my old friend Maung Aung Zan,<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> now subdivisional
officer. Though of the girth regarded as
suitable for a high official, and weighing, as he told
me, 45 viss,<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Aung Zan found a pony to carry him.
His local knowledge was invaluable. We came to
Mansi, at the end of the Banmauk road, which
breaks off so abruptly that one feels as if another
step would take one over the world’s edge into the
abyss. Here was some excitement, the police post
being threatened by a jungle fire rapidly nearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
the wooden stockade. In these remote parts the
people, of Shan race, were primitive folk of simple
and engaging manners. Extremely poor, they earned
a scanty livelihood in the forests, or by fishing, or
by laborious cultivation of miscellaneous crops. Here,
as elsewhere, courtesy and hospitality abounded.
At the entrance of every village the headman and
villagers came out to welcome us, the girls dressed
in their simple best, bearing offerings of water and
flowers. Inspecting a Court on this tour, I was
refreshed by finding a case in which trial by ordeal
for witchcraft was the main incident. The suspected
witch was tied up in the fearless old fashion, and
thrown into a stream. As she sank, and was with
difficulty rescued, her innocence was made clear.
The cause of action in the judicial case was her
claim for damages for defamation. She was awarded
£4 and costs.</p>

<p>The Commissionership of the Northern Division
was probably the most interesting office in Burma.
Mandalay itself always seemed to me a goodly place
wherein to live. ’Tis true that for a couple of months
or so the heat is great; but though the thermometer
rises to 110° or more, the climate is dry, and yet we
do not seem to have the excessive, suffocating heat,
day and night, of the plains of Northern India.
Again, every æsthetic and artistic taste is gratified.
Never to be forgotten are the battlements of the
walls, the purple shadows on the eastern hills, the
glowing sunsets on the moat, the splendour of moonlight
in the Palace corridors. The frontier work was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
absorbing, and occasionally exciting; the ordinary
executive work enough to occupy one’s time without
being unduly exacting. Of the touring I have
already tried to create an impression. Just across
the road, too, so to speak, was the new hill-station
of May-my̆o, then coming into notice. The railway
to Lashio, in the Northern Shan States, was being
made, and had not yet reached May-my̆o; but it
was easy to get up for a week-end. A drive of
fourteen miles along the Aungbinle-bund to Tônbo,
then a ride of thirty miles, with a change of ponies
at Pyintha; with an early start, May-my̆o was
reached in time for breakfast. We rode up by the
railway road to the Zibingyi plateau, a craggy path
sometimes rendered hazardous by showers of boulders
rained down after blasting operations on the line
above. Thence part of the route was over the
plateau, through pleasant jungle-tracks, part along
the embankment, where the rails were not yet laid.
Returning by the same way, we got back to Mandalay
by office-hours on Monday. May-my̆o was
still in bud, perhaps even more delightful than in
its fuller bloom. Sweet were the rides through
bracken and underwood, with the chance of losing
one’s way and a possible thrill of meeting a bear.
And cheerful the gatherings at the Club, the trivial
social pleasures in which all took part. Mandalay
itself was a large military station, where good-fellowship
has always reigned.</p>

<p>It was therefore with regret that, early in 1894,
I received Sir Alexander Mackenzie’s summons to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
Rangoon to act as Chief Secretary for Mr. Symes,
on furlough. At the time I was acting as Judicial
Commissioner in a temporary vacancy caused by
Mr. Burgess’s absence on privilege leave. As was
our custom in those days, I obeyed the order without
remonstrance.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
LOWER BURMA ONCE MORE</h2>

<p>The next three years, with a brief interlude of
privilege leave, were spent in Lower Burma. I was
Chief Secretary for a year under Sir Alexander
Mackenzie, for nine months under Sir Frederic
Fryer, for three months under Mr. Donald Smeaton,
who acted in a privilege-leave vacancy. Work was
sufficient, not excessive. The Province was in order,
and the Secretariat was administered on more regular
lines than in the earlier strenuous years. It was no
longer necessary to burn the midnight oil or to
abjure exercise and recreation. Sir Alexander Mackenzie
was a man of extraordinary capacity, and of
abnormal, in my experience unexampled, speed of
work. Throughout the day four Secretaries toiled
and filled office-boxes with files; by nine o’clock
next morning all came back with the Chief Commissioner’s
orders noted on them. It hardly seemed
as if he could have had time to untie the bundles.
Yet we had frequent evidence that cases were not
dealt with perfunctorily. The speed with which
Sir Alexander Mackenzie got to the root of a case,
however elaborate or involved, seemed almost super<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>natural.
He left the Secretaries to do their own
work, and wrote less than any other Chief I have
known. A line of his writing would be the basis of
a long draft. The least obstinate of men, he invited
criticism and free expression of opinion, and was not
afraid of changing his mind. But he was the strong
man, the mainspring and motive-power of the
Administration. No Secretary cherished the delusion
that he was running the Province. We felt that he
was the player whose organ-keys were thunders, and
we, beneath his foot, the pedal pressed. Parenthetically,
it may be observed that in Burma, and probably
in other Provinces which do not enjoy the
blessing of Executive Councils, the theory that
Secretaries are supreme has no foundation in fact.
The power and subtle intrigues ascribed to provincial
Secretariats are the vain imaginings of people who
have had no experience of their working from within.
The nonsense asserted or hinted by such persons is
incredible, and would be ludicrous but for its effect
on others equally ill-informed. Sir Alexander Mackenzie
was a genial and appreciative Chief, under
whom it was a pleasure to work. As an administrator
he was not in the same class as his immediate
predecessor, nor did he inspire the personal enthusiasm
and affection which many of us felt for
Sir Charles Bernard and Sir Charles Crosthwaite.
But we respected his marvellous ability, and were
grateful for his uniform kindness. According to
popular belief, having finished his work before
breakfast, he spent the rest of the day on a sofa
reading light literature till it was time for tennis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>A distinguished visitor to Burma at this time was
Lord Randolph Churchill. As Secretary of State
when Upper Burma was annexed, he had a close
association with the Province. The recollection of
this was often in his mind, and gave a personal
interest to his visit to Mandalay. His coming to
Burma was tinged with melancholy, as his health
was broken, and it was not long before his premature
death. It is a privilege to have met him, even
though not in his brilliant day, and it is a pleasant
thought that he was able to see the country which
he was instrumental in adding to the Empire.</p>

<p>Again I must confess that life in the Secretariat,
interesting enough to the workers, presented few
incidents likely to enthrall the most sympathetic
reader. The more smoothly the machinery worked,
the fewer sparks were thrown off. Even in the
Province, the happier the people, the less material
for the bookmaker. True, there were exciting
events even in that peaceful time. Two which
startled us out of our equanimity may be recalled.
Mr. Tucker, a member of a well-known family, many
of whom have served the Crown in India, at the
time District Superintendent of Police in Pegu, was
an excellent shot and a notable sportsman. One
night, when on tour in a country boat, he was
aroused by the report of a dacoity close by. Leaping
on shore at once, and calling to his boy<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> to
bring his gun and cartridges, he hastened towards
the scene. As he ran along the bank, he was shot
dead by dacoits, without a chance of defending him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>self.
It was one of the ironies of fate that he, better
than most men qualified for resistance, should have
fallen thus obscurely. One by one all concerned in
the crime were brought to justice, though some
years passed before the tale was complete. The
other lurid incident was the plunder of the mail-train
between Yamèthin and Pyinmana, when
Nelson, the guard, was murdered. The miscreants
who perpetrated this daring outrage are believed to
have been natives of India, formerly employed on
the railway and conversant with its working.
Boarding the train at Yamèthin, they tampered
with the couplings of the brake-van, of which one
compartment was obligingly labelled “Treasure and
valuables.” At a lonely place they completed the
severance of the van from the rest of the train, which
went on, unconscious of the act. The unarmed
guard was cut down and the treasure carried off.
It was believed at the time that the real criminals
were brought to trial. After protracted proceedings,
they were finally acquitted on appeal.</p>

<p>The year 1896 saw the very last of the dacoit Bos.
Ten years before, Bo Cho had harried Myingyan and
Pagan, the leader of a formidable gang; once, when
he met Captain Eyre, he is said to have led seven
hundred men. Unlike other Bos, he was neither
killed nor captured, nor did he surrender. When
his band melted away, and dacoity became too
hazardous a sport, he simply disappeared. Either
he was dead, or he had plunged into effectual
obscurity in the comparatively dense population of
the Delta. Actually, he was living as a peaceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
cultivator in a village in the middle of the Myingyan
district. There he might have spent the rest of his
days, perhaps becoming in time a Kyaung-taga, or
even a Headman. No one would have dreamt of
betraying him even for the price set upon his
capture. Did not the munificent offer of Rs. 20,000
fail to tempt any follower of Gaung Gyi?<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
But after a time, apparently weary of a life of
inaction, Bo Cho became restless. With two sons,
he took to the jungle and began again the old trade
of dacoity. Experience of the early years of the
pacification was utilized. Mr. W. R. Stone,<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> a
newly joined Assistant Commissioner, with a small
force of military and civil police, and with selected
Burman officers to help him, was told off to catch
Bo Cho. He was given full authority under the
Village Regulation, and a free hand. The invaluable
power of removing to a distance friends and
relatives of dacoits was unsparingly exercised. In
a few weeks Mr. Stone dispersed the gang and
captured Bo Cho and his sons, who were duly
hanged in the Myingyan Jail.</p>

<p class="caption smcap">Bo Cho and his sons.</p>
</div>

<p>Rejoining after short leave at the end of 1896,
I became Commissioner of the Irrawaddy division,
and after many years again saw Bassein and even
Pantanaw. Seen in the light of larger experience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
and from the melancholy mound of advancing years,
Bassein seemed quite different from the gay station
of our giddy youth. Really, it was much the same,
and in some ways it had improved. I found many
old friends among Burmans, officials, advocates, and
traders. Every greybeard wagged his head and
welcomed me as contemporary. Seriously, I was
very glad to see these old gentlemen, and not to find
myself forgotten. But I could not disguise from
myself, perhaps not from others, that my heart was
in Upper Burma; that I found the Delta folk, at
least in the larger towns and villages, sophisticated
and with too large a mingling of Kalas, and that I
pined for Mandalay. The work was substantial but
not overwhelming; there was still time for the
judicial part of it. We were in Irrawaddy only for
the dry months, and were able to make some
pleasant tours. Conditions of travelling by water
were vastly better than in early days. There was
already one house-boat, which, towed by a launch,
was an agreeable substitute for the rice-boat of our
youth. The Commissioner had not yet a house-boat
of his own, such as that enjoyed by the present
pampered official; but on occasion we borrowed one
from the friendly Deputy Commissioner of Maubin,
Major Macnabb. In the northern part of the
division travelling by land was easy in the dry
weather. One exceedingly enjoyable tour in that
part lives in my memory. We rode from Henzada
to Ngathaing-gyaung traversing subdivisions held
by two native officers, Maung Tin Gyaw and Maung
Ba Bwa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>Much has been said and written about the corruption
of Burmese officials. To hear some people, you
would think there was no such rare bird, if indeed
he be not fabulous, as an honest Burman in Government
service. I am happy to say that my experience
enables me to place on record a far more
favourable judgment. It would be absurd to
pretend that corruption did not exist, even that it
was very unusual. It has been my fortune many
times to recognize, expose, and punish corrupt
officers. Both in Upper and in Lower Burma we
inherited the traditions of a feeble Oriental Government,
and it was impossible that evil practices
should not abound. Township officers and their
subordinates, all natives of the Province, exercised
great power, often free from constant and close
supervision. To the mass of the people, in their
daily life, the township officer and Thugyi, even
more than the Deputy Commissioner, represented
the Government. Furthermore, in early days the
native services were ill-paid and had poor prospects
of advancement. Till an honourable tradition was
established, it could not be expected that all would
resist the many temptations in their path. Recognizing
and admitting all these grounds of reserve,
I am satisfied that very many Burmese officers have
been perfectly honest and have faithfully justified
the trust reposed in them. Men there are in whom
I have such confidence that, were it shown to be
misplaced, my faith in human nature would be
shattered. In recent years the pay and prospects
of Burmese officers have been improved (<i>quorum pars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
exigua fui</i>). They now have fair wages and many
roads to dignity and honour. Partly for this reason,
partly from higher motives, a sound tradition is
gradually becoming crystallized, and year by year
the standard of morality is being raised.</p>

<p>Of those<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> who, in comparatively early times, set
a shining example of probity and efficiency, Maung
Tin Gyaw was a fine specimen. Of good Talaing
stock, he was one of the ablest native officers I have
known. His father and uncle, whom a flippant but
kindly, experienced, and appreciative Deputy Commissioner
used to call Romulus and Remus, were
Circle Thugyis, when I knew them venerable white-haired
men of distinguished appearance. One of
them bore honourable scars of wounds received in
action in the troubles of 1885. Maung Tin Gyaw
himself, then in the prime of life, was a man of
courage, resolution, and independence. Well educated
as a boy, but only in the vernacular, in adult
life he had succeeded in teaching himself enough
English to enable him to read the <i>Gazette</i> with
moderate ease. With lighter English literature I
fear he was unfamiliar. In his subdivision, which
he managed admirably, he had boundless personal
influence (awza), that intangible quality which
makes the administrator. Throughout his career he
preserved a reputation for spotless integrity and
honesty. Riding with us through his charge,
Maung Tin Gyaw was a very agreeable companion,
prompt in all courteous attentions, always at hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
when required, but never obtruding his society unsought.</p>

<p>At one of our halts he found a wandering monk
who had caused some commotion elsewhere, and was
regarded with suspicion as a potential cause of
political trouble. As I have said before, the wandering
monk, who gathers crowds, practises magic,
and heals the sick by charms and incantations, is
always distrusted by the district officer. When he
begins to tattoo his followers, it is time to put him
on security or send him to jail. This monk proposed
to walk through the subdivision and proceed to
Ngathaing-gyaung. Maung Tin Gyaw regarded
this proposition with disfavour. He forbade the
monk to go by land. “In fact,” said he, “that’s
a very tedious and uncomfortable way. Go back to
Henzada, where you will find a steamer which will
take you far more quickly and easily.” “Please tell
me,” replied the monk, who was of the order of sea-lawyers,
“by what law you will prevent me from
going by land.” “The law,” said Tin Gyaw, “I will
show you in Henzada. But back you shall go.”
And back he went under the friendly escort of a
couple of constables, and so far as I know he gave
no further trouble. No doubt a high-handed and
illegal proceeding, but conducive to the peace of the
district, and therefore explicitly approved by the
Commissioner. Some years ago I had to mourn Tin
Gyaw’s loss. Till his death he was one of my most
trusted and valued friends. Maung Ba Bwa, our
other companion on this tour, I am glad to say still
serves the State. I am therefore precluded from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
saying more of him than that he, too, was an officer
of distinction, who for some years managed an important
subdivision never before, I think, placed in
charge of a Burmese officer. That these subdivisions
should be entrusted to native Extra Assistant Commissioners
is an indication of the advance made
in twenty years.</p>

MANDALAY&mdash;THE BOUNDARY COMMISSION</h2>

<p>Early in 1897 I was once more in Mandalay, well
pleased to be again among my friends in Upper
Burma. In the short period of my charge of the
Mandalay Division occurred the inevitable rising for
which the time was ripe. In Burma a small rebellion
breaks out with almost seasonable regularity. One
evening, as I was on the point of going to the Club,
then sumptuously housed in the western halls of the
Palace, Mr. (now Sir George) Scott came in. Instead
of going to the Club, we drove round Mandalay
Hill. It was October, and the festival which marks
the end of Buddhist Lent was being celebrated. At
the Kuthodaw<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> Pagoda we alighted and mingled
with the crowd. Pwès were being played, and the
scene was vivid with a gay and giddy throng of
men, women, and children, decked with jewels and
clad in rainbow-coloured silks. We met several
friends, among them the Shwehlan Myowun, with
whom Mr. Scott renewed an old acquaintance.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> This
was not the time of year when disturbance is expected.
The October festival is one of peace and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
good-will, when the shadows of Lent have departed,
when merry lights go sailing down the river, when
the prospect of harvest is in sight. It is, moreover,
a sure sign that no trouble is apprehended when
women and children are seen in swarms at pwès
and public assemblies. So with cheerful hearts we
resumed our drive, while with unconscious irony I
explained to Mr. Scott the profoundness of our
security, our firm hold on Mandalay, my confidence
that nothing untoward could happen without timely
warning. We sat down to dinner, and got as far as
coffee and cheroots. Sir George Scott still regrets
that he never tasted that coffee. For at this moment
in ran Mr. Snadden, the Superintendent of Police,
saying: “There is an insurrection. You had better
come and see about it.” When we arrived on the
scene, the insurrection had been suppressed. A very
agèd monk had announced himself as the coming
King, the reincarnation of a Prince dead some
centuries ago. He possessed the power of making
his followers invisible and invulnerable, always an
advantage, especially to a small force contending
against superior numbers. Perhaps his forces would
not be so small, for presently he would throw leaves
into the air and they would come down as armed
men. His occult power he proved by walking thrice
round his monastery and disappearing from sight.
“Of course,” said the Kinwun Mingyi, as he related
the story afterwards, not wishing to impose upon
my simplicity, “he hid himself somewhere.” With
such old wives’ tales, and with promises of place and
power, he beguiled a score of wretched dupes, mostly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
as old as himself. They sat and plotted beneath
the humble mat-and-thatch monastery where the
monk lived. My confidence that we should be
warned in time was not misplaced. The local police
inspector was told by a woman that a conspiracy
was being hatched. The cry of “Wolf!” had been
so often raised that he was mildly incredulous.
When she led him to see the conspirators, and he
found a lot of old men telling their beads, his
unbelief was confirmed, and he declined to listen to
the story. His want of faith cost him his appointment.</p>

<p>When the eventful evening came, armed only with
swords and short spears hidden in the sleeves of
their jackets, without a firearm of any kind, the
little band marched to the taking of the walled city
of Mandalay, garrisoned by two or three regiments.
Their goal was the Palace where, said the monk,
“when I take my seat on the throne, Burma will
be my kingdom and the heretic kalas will flee.”
Almost at the outset, they were diverted from their
purpose. Crossing the moat by the South Bridge,
they came upon a British soldier walking with an
Englishwoman. “Behold the enemy; slay them,”
cried the mad monk. Hotly pursued, the luckless
pair ran through the South Gate.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> I regret to say
that the police guard at the gate fled. Close by, in
a large compound, stood the house of Major W. H.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
Dobbie<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> of the Indian Army. The woman ran along
the garden fence, while the man darted in and gave
the alarm. Then this nameless hero, alone and unarmed,
went back to help his companion and met
death unafraid. The woman, grievously wounded,
survived. With his revolver, and supplied with
cartridges by his gallant wife, Major Dobbie ran out
and met the rebels at his gate. Single-handed, he
held them at bay, doing much execution, till some
other officers, attracted by the firing, came to his
aid and completed the rout. In the city gateway a
running fight ensued. The white walls were splashed
with blood which long remained a memorial of that
stirring night. One officer received a cut on the
head. Of the rebels, five, including the leader, were
killed and most were wounded. If the band had
pursued its original intention and made straight for
the Palace, it would have come upon a few peaceful
gentlemen sitting at dinner in the club with no
weapons of defence handier than chairs and table-knives.
The attempt was an isolated affair, of no
political significance, confined to the few fanatics
actually engaged. Patrols were sent out and
rewards proclaimed. Within a week we picked up
all the surviving rebels. After trial, ten were
hanged in the presence of many spectators; the
rest were sent to transportation. In the jail I spoke
to one of the leaders, a man of fair position, somewhat
past middle age, the Kappiya-taga<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
dead monk’s monastery. He explained that he had
no enmity or cause of enmity against Government.
Ambition was the motive which impelled him. He
was to be the new King’s Chief Minister. The
fortune of war being against him, he submitted to
the penalty without complaint.</p>

<p>The story is pitiful enough. These petty risings
are of periodical occurrence, and seem to be peculiar
to Burma. Three or four have broken out in the
last few years. They are never of sufficient importance
to cause any anxiety to Government. The
sorrow and misery fall on ignorant, misguided
peasants who are led astray by some <i>soi-disant</i>
Prince. Always a pretender to royal blood, a
Minlaung or embryo Prince, with power to work
marvels, to bring fire forth from his arm, to kindle
mystic lights, or cause gilding to be laid by unseen
hands on a pagoda; always fairy-tales of charms
against death and wounds. It seems impossible to
cure this insane disease of flocking to a pretender’s
standard. For the sake of the people themselves,
these outbreaks must be suppressed with severity.
We used to regard crimes against the State as
crimes of the worst character, not as venial offences
to be treated tenderly. This is the only kind of
sedition which has hitherto troubled Burma. The
mass of the people, no less than the educated classes,
are too proud to follow demagogues from Bombay or
Bengal. They seem to be too intelligent to hanker
after representative institutions unsuited to the
genius of the race. Recognizing that they already
take a great part in the administration, they feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
assured that as they show themselves fit, higher
offices will be thrown open to their ambition. Enlightened
Burmans see that the good of the people
is the sole desire of Government, and that this is
promoted by due submission to constituted authority,
not by liberty of fluent rhetoric. While, therefore,
other parts of India were seething with sedition,
Burma alone remained unmoved, pursuing its steady
march of progress. The speed of the march would
be accelerated if Burma had more of its own money
to spend, and if it were not often hampered by being
made to conform to Indian precedents. All that we
knew of sedition was the deportation of certain ring-leaders
to Burma, where they were not likely to be
regarded with any interest or sympathy.</p>

<p>Towards the close of this year I relinquished
charge of the Division on appointment to be Her
Majesty’s Commissioner for demarcating the boundary
between Burma and China. The settlement of
this boundary had long been under discussion
between the two Governments. In 1893 had been
concluded a Convention fixing a boundary-line very
unfavourable to Burma. As already mentioned,
Sima went to China and farther south the frontier
was drawn perilously near Bhamo. Fortunately, an
opportunity of revising this Convention occurred.
The new Agreement laid down a line more practical
and more in accordance with historical evidence.
In the winter of 1897 a Joint Commission was
appointed to ascertain and demarcate on the ground
the frontier defined in the revised Convention.
Mr. E. C. S. George was Assistant Commissioner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
My Chinese colleague was General Liu, with several
Chinese assistants and a telegraph clerk as interpreter.
The Commission assembled at Bhamo as
arranged. A few days were spent in settling preliminaries
and exchanging courtesies. General Liu
and his officers dined with us and we in turn were
entertained at a Chinese feast. With some confidence,
we set out for the frontier. Mr. George,
with one of the Chinese Commissioners, was deputed
to demarcate north of the Taiping as far as the high
conical peak in latitude 25° 35′, the extreme point
mentioned in the Convention. With his customary
vigour and decision, overcoming many difficulties,
he accomplished his task. General Liu and I proposed
to demarcate south of the Taiping. Of the
party were Mr. W. Warry<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> of the China Consular
Service, Major F. B. Longe<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> of the Survey of India,
Captain E. W. M. Norie<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> of the Middlesex Regiment,
Intelligence Officer, and Mr. D. W. Rae of
the Provincial Service, an officer of tried experience
in the Kachin Hills. Captain J. W. L. ffrench-Mullen<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
commanded the modest escort of a hundred
rifles of military police.</p>

<p>We marched due east, through the pleasant hill-station
of Sinlumgaba, past terraced rice-fields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
watered by ingenious irrigation works, over shallow
streams. With more than the wonted vigour of
Chinese officials, General Liu exchanged his sedan-chair
for a rough pony, and rode at the head of his
ragged escort. The result did not justify the
promise of the beginning. Almost at the outset, in
circumstances with which I need not weary my
readers, we came to a deadlock. Though the case
was obviously one for compromise, General Liu, most
courteous and most obstinate of men, declined to
come to terms. There was no alternative but to
refer the matter to our respective Governments,
and await their orders. So after a very few
days we settled down on the banks of a stream
which up to that time had marked the provisional
boundary.</p>

<p>Four weary months we spent beside that miserable
stream, our escort on the Burmese side, the Chinese
escort on the farther bank, occupying our time in
sending urgent appeals to Government, and in
holding endless conferences with our Chinese colleagues.
Our men, disciplined and well equipped,
were under canvas, properly rationed and cared for
by our medical officer. Among them were a few
Kachins recently enlisted, very smart and proud of
their new uniforms. Boots were to them at once
a source of glory and of pain. Most of them
marched bare-footed, carrying the precious but
weary burden slung on their shoulders. In a village
they put them on and swaggered about for the
admiration of the girls. Hardy and brave, these
mountaineers are likely to prove excellent material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
for military police, perhaps even for the regular
army. This season they were blooded in a small
affair which Mr. H. F. Hertz had with an intrusive
body of Chinese. They were among the first to
scale the enemy’s stockade. There are now several
companies of Kachins in the battalions at Bhamo
and Myitkyina. General Liu had his hundred
Chinese braves, clad in picturesque rags, undisciplined,
armed with the latest thing in rifles, which
they had no idea how to use. They carried no
tents, and had to house themselves in huts of leaf
and bamboo. The comfortable arrangements made
for our military police filled them with envy, and
they gratefully accepted the attention of our
surgeon. We could have enlisted as many as we
pleased if we had wished to raise a Chinese
battalion. They impressed us as being good raw
material and quite well behaved, but in their existing
conditions entirely useless as a fighting force. The
futility of Chinese troops against a disciplined army
has been abundantly exemplified on this frontier.
Notwithstanding warnings and alarms in the Press
of the presence of formidable arrays trained by
German or Japanese instructors, and armed with
rifles of the very newest pattern, we have never
encountered from Yunnan a Chinese levy capable of
standing up to our military police, far less to a
British force of all arms.</p>

<p>General Liu was a sturdy old man, who had seen
service in the field. Although he succeeded in
wasting the whole season, and broke solemn compacts
with a serene smile, our relations on the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
were friendly. He wrote me innumerable despatches,
adorned with the noblest moral sentiments, but in
substance quite inconsequent. This was in accordance
with established tradition. Very often he
crossed over to our camp and talked for hours,
probably for the benefit of his assistants and the
egregious telegraph clerk. After drinking a liqueur,
he would return to his own side of the stream,
conscious of a morning well spent, and sit under a
tree, cooling his head after the heat of argument.
Among interesting visitors to his camp were
Sawbwas of the Chinese Shan States, which lie
along the border. These chiefs occupy very much
the same position as those of our own Shan States.
At times they enjoy greater freedom, at times are
more severely repressed, than their brothers in
Burma. One of them cherished a beard which
Shagpat might have envied; except on occasions of
display, he kept it encased in a bag. Incidentally
we were surprised by the arrival in our camp of two
English travellers, who announced that they had
travelled through China, and had just come from
Lasa. Their report was received with derision by
a correspondent, who thought that Lasa was the
storied capital of Tibet, then untrodden ground.
Their Lasa is one of the Chinese Shan States. In
the course of the season we had a very effective
eclipse, and were privileged to witness the Chinese
beating gongs and making an incredible noise to
frighten away the dragon devouring the sun, a
custom of which we had heard, but hitherto had
only in part believed to exist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>Such were the trivial incidents which helped to
pass the weary days, as we sat in our tents pitched
in the midst of bare rice-fields, on a plateau some
four thousand feet above the sea. Till the middle
of March the climate was cold and bracing, with a
sharp frost that covered buckets of water with ice
an inch or two thick, at first an object of surprise
and admiration to my Burman boy from the plains.
We diverted ourselves as best we might, and from
first to last were all good friends. By the camp-fire
at night many a story was told. But that it
was a monotonous time cannot be gainsaid. Even
the resource of shooting was almost entirely absent.
The hills swarmed with guns, old-fashioned muskets
for the most part, and the Kachins very successfully
kept down the game. We rode about the country
for relaxation, visiting Kachin villages, and making
the acquaintance of many Duwas. The most interesting
was the blind Chief of Matang (Matin), a
man of real influence, who had been of service to
Colonel Sladen on his mission to Yunnan in 1868.
Once or twice we visited Sinlumgaba, already mentioned
as a budding hill-station, and were cordially
welcomed by the gunners out for practice at the
neighbouring hill of Imlumshan. Somehow or other
the months passed, in daily expectation of orders
from Government enabling us to make a start. I
do not know what was the cause of the delay. At
last, at the end of the season, the long-awaited
orders came. But it was too late. We parted
from General Liu with mutual protestations of
respect and affection. In spite of his obstinacy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
duplicity, and pious dissertations, I could not help
liking the old man.</p>

<p>After writing my report and forming plans for
the ensuing season, I acted for a time as Judicial
Commissioner of Upper Burma. Towards the end
of 1898 the permanent appointment became vacant,
owing to the lamented death of Mr. Burgess. I
was given the option of succeeding him or of retaining
the office of Boundary Commissioner. I accepted
the post of Judicial Commissioner. The demarcation
of the boundary was successfully carried out in the
next two seasons by Sir George Scott and Mr.
George.</p>

<p>Judicial work in Upper Burma, which occupied
me for the next two years, was interesting but not
exciting. The volume of work was sufficient, not
beyond the pursuit of zeal and industry. The
forensic part was varied and often entertaining,
involving many studies of Buddhist law and indigenous
customs. Though not a very litigious
people, Burmans hate being treated, as they think,
unjustly. I have known a case where only a few
pence were at stake carried through all the Courts
up to Mandalay. Besides hearing appeals and
revisions as a High Court, the Judicial Commissioner
had to supervise, and, where necessary, instruct the
subordinate judiciary. The judicial system was less
elaborate than in other Provinces, and many magistrates
and Judges retained characteristics acquired
under Burmese rule. They did their best, and
administered what was perhaps at times a wild
kind of justice. They had the Civil Procedure Code<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
thrust on them, <i>me judice</i>, at too early a date, but
they bore the infliction with resignation. The
Judicial Commissioner’s duties involved a fair
amount of administration and a good deal of
inspection. With the members of the small but
efficient Bar his relations were friendly and cordial.</p>

<p>The Judicial Commissioner held sway within the
limits of his powers over all Upper Burma save,
mercifully for them, the Shan States and the Chin
and Kachin Hills. Inspections included many
parts of the Province by me before unvisited. Of
these brief visits, full of interest at the time, it
were tedious to write at length. A sample may
be given. Early one morning I landed at a wayside
village to inspect the township court. A
graceful little pandal<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> had been erected wherein I
was invited to witness a pwè before beginning work.
Innocently consenting, I took my seat and the
performance began. Dancers came, not single spies,
but in battalions. Every village in the neighbourhood
had sent its troupe, each eager in succession
to display its skill and grace. Except one, all the
companies consisted of quite young girls, not professionals,
but daughters of the village. The last
turn was given by a band of small boys delightfully
dressed in green jackets and knickerbockers. This
was much more amusing than turning over dusty
files and registers. But all good things come to
an end, and after some pleasant hours I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
reluctantly to obey the call of duty. In the end,
I breakfasted at 5 o’clock tea. There is a sequel
to the story. On my return to Mandalay I received
a petition signed by the girls of one of the troupes.
It was more clement than the petition of Salome.
The memorialists had danced, and I had been
pleased to look and express approval. Such poor
skill as they had was due to the training of their
saya.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> This worthy man had fallen on evil days.
By the craft and subtlety of his enemies, he had
been wrongfully prosecuted for embezzlement, unjustly
convicted, and barbarously sentenced to imprisonment.
If he stayed in durance, his lessons
would be forgotten, and his pupils would be able
to dance no more. Would I kindly, as a personal
favour to them, order his instant release? The
impulse of the natural man was to grant on the
spot this ingenuous gracefully worded request.
Hardening my heart, I yet examined the record of
the trial with every desire to find a reason for
intervention. Alas! I could not convince myself
that the saya was an injured innocent. All that
the girls got by their memorial was a civil answer,
in which I tried to explain why their request could
not be granted. I hope they gave me credit for the
wish to help them.</p>

<p>It should be a truism, but is too seldom recognized,
that the less the higher Courts interfere, especially
on technical grounds, the better. Now and then,
however, it was pleasing to be able of one’s own
motion to throw open the prison gates. Very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
gratifying it was to set at liberty a man sentenced
to a long term of imprisonment for exceeding the
right of private defence against an armed robber.
To me he seemed deserving of reward rather than
punishment. I doubt if any act of my official life
gave me greater pleasure than restoring a young
woman to freedom. Inspecting a gaol, I found a
young Burmese girl, the solitary occupant of the
woman’s side. In an agony of grief at her husband’s
sudden death she had tried to commit suicide. For
this heinous crime she had been sentenced to imprisonment
for three months. On her ready promise
not to do it again, I was able to release her at once.</p>

<p>For a few weeks in 1899, by arrangement with
Mr. F. S. Copleston, C.S., who, solely for my convenience,
changed places with me, I held the office
of Judicial Commissioner of Lower Burma, a thankless
post, of which the work exceeded my capacity.</p>

<p>In 1900 the Chief Court of Lower Burma was
established, Mr. Copleston becoming the first Chief
Judge. The selection was vehemently criticized,
the local Bar and Press clamouring for the appointment
of a barrister and for Mr. Copleston’s head on
a charger. I should like to explain the reasons
which may be urged in support of the appointment
of a civilian. The judicious skipper will perhaps
be warned, and avoid the next page or two. It is
open to argument that there should not be any
civilian Judges; that, as in England, all Judges should
be barristers trained in forensic practice. This
argument is not seriously advanced by anyone
conversant with the conditions, and need not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
traversed at length. But the situation may be
briefly stated. From the beginning of their service,
civilians are constantly doing judicial work, always
criminal, generally civil. In the five-and-twenty
years or so that pass before they are likely to enter
a High or Chief Court, those who have any aptitude
or inclination for legal studies have had abundant
experience and have acquired a good stock of learning.
Where there is a division between the executive
and judicial branches, certain officers specialize
almost exclusively. Civilians of my own standing
had even an earlier training. During their term
of probation law formed a prominent part of
their reading. Periodical examinations tested
their proficiency, and they had also to attend
Courts and prepare notes of cases. They saw in
practice the daily working of Courts under the
presidency of the best Judges and magistrates in
England. A selected candidate who failed at the
Final Examination to qualify in law was ruthlessly
rejected, excluded for ever from the paradise of the
Civil Service. It is thought by some not unintelligent
persons that in the trial of civil and criminal
causes it is an advantage for the Judge to have
knowledge of the language, customs, and character
of the people concerned. Apart from this, every
High and Chief Court in India has civilian Judges,
by common consent as well qualified as their barrister
colleagues. So much for the appointment of any
civilians as Judges. Now for the question of the
Chief Judge. In the Chief Court of Lower Burma,
with which we are immediately concerned, in forensic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
business the Chief Judge has no more weight or
authority than any of his puisne brothers. Only
when all the Judges are sitting as a Bench, and
when they are equally divided, has the Chief Judge
a casting-vote. As yet that instance has not happened.
Ordinarily, in court the Chief Judge is on
terms of exact equality with his colleagues. As a
member of a Bench he can be outvoted by his
juniors. His decision as a single judge can be considered,
modified, or overruled by a Bench, of which
he may or may not be a member. So far as judicial
work is concerned, every objection to the appointment
of a civilian as Chief Judge can be urged with
equal force to the appointment of any civilians as
Judges. But the work is not exclusively judicial.
It includes also administrative functions. The Chief
Court initiates or advises upon many matters connected
with the judicial administration. All subordinate
Judges and magistrates, most of them
Burmans, are under its supervision. In this branch
of the duties of the Court the leading part is necessarily
taken by the Chief Judge. It is therefore
desirable that he should have administrative experience,
and, if possible, good knowledge of the people.
For these reasons public interest is better served by
the selection of a civilian as Chief Judge. I do not
care to discuss the vulgar suggestion, not seriously
made by any decent person, that civilian Judges are
more likely to be subservient to Government than
barristers. No one believes this; nor would it
apply particularly to the Chief Judge, who, as I
have said, has no more power judicially than his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
colleagues. The only sound rule is for Government
to appoint as Chief Judge the man believed to be
best qualified for the office, whether civilian or
barrister, bearing in mind that administrative as
well as purely legal qualifications are requisite.</p>

<p>Some time ago there was an agitation for the
establishment of a High Court for Burma in place
of the Chief Court and Judicial Commissioner. No
doubt Judges of the Chief Court should receive the
same pay as Judges of a High Court. They do
exactly the same work, and are of the same standing.
Apart from this, in my humble judgment, the establishment
of a High Court would be an unmixed evil.
Upper Burma is not ripe for even the mild sway of
the Chief Court. For both litigants and Judges it is
better to remain under the sympathetic control of
the Judicial Commissioner, whose learning is tempered
by sympathy with the people. It would also
be disastrous for suitors from Upper Burma to have
to come to Rangoon, practically a foreign city,
instead of Mandalay, where they are at home.
Besides these objections, the establishment of a
High Court would involve the appointment on every
occasion of a barrister Chief Justice, which I hope
I have shown to be inexpedient. As puisne Judges,
barristers would be sent from England. One need
not believe spiteful stories of political jobs, and one
may respect many Judges of High Courts; but it
cannot be contended that an Indian career now
attracts the pick of the English Bar, men in first-class
practice or with good prospects. Recent
experience has, I trust, quenched whatever desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
there may have been for the establishment of a
High Court in Rangoon. But enough of controversy.</p>

<p>At the end of 1898 Lord Elgin visited Burma, on
the very eve of his departure from India.</p>

<p>In the last few months of my last residence in
Mandalay, no suitable house being available, I
occupied my old quarters in the Palace, with the
White Pavilion<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> opposite. Except for the Club on
the western side and a few offices, the Palace was
untenanted. Burmans ranged it at will, much
interested in pacing its corridors and examining its
stately rooms. They certainly did not regard the
Palace with awe or reverence, but were well pleased
to satisfy their curiosity. On feast days crowds
came to picnic in the gardens and loitered in my
courtyard. All climbed up the Queen’s Tower, and
all counted the steps as they descended. At night,
save for a few watchmen, most of the Palace was
left in solitude. Very striking was the effect as
one’s footsteps sounded hollow on the boarded floors,
while the tropic moon flooded the columned arcades
with unearthly light. Revolving many memories and
picturing many scenes of bygone days, I traversed
the deserted halls.</p>

<p>At the end of 1900, the day after the completion
of my obligatory service in India, I went on furlough,
free to retire at the end of two years. Mr. Harvey
Adamson<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> succeeded to the appointment.</p>

THE CHIEF COURT&mdash;LAST YEARS IN BURMA</h2>

<p>After spending rather more than a year in Europe,
I was tempted back to Burma by the offer of the
post of Chief Judge in succession to Mr. Copleston,
who retired from the Service. I held the office
for three years, from 1902 to 1905. These are years
of pleasant memory, mainly on account of the very
cordial relations with my colleagues, and especially
the kindness and friendship of the barrister Judges.
Of the Bar also I have a grateful remembrance. Its
members were pleased to speak appreciatively of me
on my departure. I risk the double edge.</p>

<p>The most interesting event of these years was the
Durbar at Delhi held by Lord Curzon on New Year’s
Day, 1903, to celebrate the Coronation of His
Majesty King Edward VII. I do not propose to
tell a twice-told tale by describing the Durbar and
its attendant ceremonies. But a brief reference
may be permitted. A splendid pageant was the
State Entry, with its long line of richly caparisoned
elephants, its dazzling array of Chiefs in gorgeous
vestments, seen by thousands from the terraces of
the Jamma Musjid. Glorious and soul-stirring was
the Durbar itself with all the pomp of heraldry and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
blazonry of colour. Perhaps the most moving
incident was the appearance of a body of Mutiny
veterans, conspicuous among them white-haired men
of many Indian races who had been faithful to their
salt. The Shan chiefs, humble folk among the
stately Indian Rajas, were yet in their grotesque
attire a picturesque feature of the State Entry, and
attracted notice as they paid homage at the Durbar.
Not soon to be forgotten was the review of native
retainers, where the followers of many Chiefs displayed
curious customs and equipment handed down
from remote antiquity. Perhaps the most charming
ceremony was the State Ball in the Diwan-i-Am
(with supper in the Diwan-i-Khas), where Europeans
and Indians, gleaming with gold and jewels and
radiant colour, flashed and glittered in the historic
halls of the Moguls. The conception of the Durbar
and of the incidents grouped round that memorable
scene was worthy of the great event which they
celebrated. The Burma camp was, as usual,
admirably arranged and managed; the griffins,
which characteristically guarded the gateway, a
piece of Burma set down in the Punjab plain.
The guests hospitably entertained there owe a debt
of gratitude to Sir Frederic and Lady Fryer and
His Honour’s able and courteous staff for many
pleasant days. That fortnight remains in my mind
as a charming episode.</p>

<p>In 1905, Lord Curzon appointed me to be
Lieutenant-Governor in succession to Sir Hugh
Barnes, who went to the Council of India. Sir
Harvey Adamson became Chief Judge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in 1906 the Province was honoured by the
visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales. Their
Royal Highnesses were received with unbounded
enthusiasm by all classes and races in Burma. Their
gracious kindness and consideration had the happiest
effect in exciting the loyalty of the Burmese people.
To Rangoon and Mandalay, Shan chiefs and many
strange folk from remote hills and valleys, Chins,
Kachins, Karens, Was, Padaungs, Brès, flocked to
do homage. Proceeding down the river to Prome
in a steamer fitted up by the Flotilla Company,
Their Royal Highnesses saw a great deal of the
country in a short time. The memory of their
visit will not fade from the minds of those privileged
to see them, and will be handed down as a glowing
tradition to posterity.</p>

<p>Next year the Duke and Duchess of Connaught
and Princess Patricia came to Burma, and were
welcomed with acclamation. Their Royal Highnesses
visited Rangoon, Mandalay, and Pagan,
thus seeing the most interesting places in the
Province.</p>

<p>In 1907 the Viceroy, Lord Minto, with Lady
Minto, paid us a visit, and spent nearly a month
in Burma. Their Excellencies saw Rangoon, Mandalay,
Lashio, Myitkyina, Bhamo, Pagan, and
Prome. Coming, like Lord Curzon, early in his
term of office, Lord Minto obtained an insight into
the conditions of Burma, and became interested in
the Province. The most memorable incident of his
visit was the Durbar held by His Excellency in the
Eastern Hall of Audience in the Palace at Man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>dalay,
the first public ceremony held there since
Lord Dufferin’s Levée in 1886.</p>

<p>Although to Lord Curzon I owed my appointment
as Lieutenant-Governor, I was not in Burma
at the time of his visit, nor was it my privilege to
serve directly under him for many months. Most
illustrious of the eminent statesmen who have held
the high office of Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon left,
regretted by all who had at heart the interests of the
Empire and the good of the people. It is presumptuous
of me to attempt any appreciation of his work
or to raise my feeble voice in eulogy. Yet, having
served under him, I cannot be altogether silent.
Lord Curzon set the example of the loftiest ideal.
Inspiring the heartiest enthusiasm in those brought
into personal relations with him, he spared no pains
to raise the standard of efficiency, to reform abuses,
to promote the well-being of the people of India.
When the dust of controversy shall have been laid,
the historian will see clearly, in true perspective,
how noble a task he accomplished in the years, all
too few, of his Viceroyalty.</p>

<p>So long as Burma remains a Province of India,
her geographical position will place her at a disadvantage
in comparison with other Provinces.
Members of Council pay sparing and infrequent
visits, and seldom have any knowledge of the
country and the people. Nor has the Lieutenant-Governor
many opportunities of visiting the headquarters
of Government. Only once, towards the
end of my term of office, did I go to Calcutta.
While I was at Government House, except one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
Member who came on a private excursion, giving
me no warning of his coming, and whom I never
saw, only two Members of Council, Sir Denzil
Ibbetson,<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> and Mr. W. L. Harvey, came to Burma.
It was a pleasure and a privilege to make the
acquaintance of Sir Denzil Ibbetson. His coming,
though unavoidably deferred till the last moment,
was of advantage to the Province. The same may
be said of Mr. Harvey’s visit. Sir Denzil Ibbetson
and Mr. Harvey were lost to India soon afterwards.
Both were men of character, ability, and distinction,
whom we could ill spare.</p>

<p>Distance and the pressure of overwhelming official
cares kept away the Financial Member.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> This was
specially to be regretted. For the new Provincial
Settlement, cynically styled a Contract, was discussed
and determined. The debate was one-sided,
and recalled the schoolboys’ tag: “Si rixa est, ubi
tu pulsas, ego vapulo tantum.”</p>

<p>Burma fared badly in this unequal contest, where
the decision rested solely with the Supreme Government.
The situation may be described in popular
terms. Apart from local funds, revenue and expenditure
in India are divided into Imperial and
Provincial. All the revenue is raised in the Provinces,
the Government of India having no separate
estate. Imperial expenditure, including the cost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
of the Central Government, the army, and Home
charges, has to be met by contributions from the
Provinces. Certain heads of revenue are Imperial,
others provincial; others are divided between the
two. It is right and fair that Burma as well as
other Provinces should contribute to Imperial needs.
Only very foolish people believe that the Government
of India depends upon Burma for its livelihood,
so to speak. The poor old milch-cow has been
trotted out too often, and has become a wearisome,
time-worn beast. In fact, the contribution paid by
Burma is actually less than that paid by the richer
Provinces. At the same time it is true that the
contribution from Burma is greater in proportion to
its population than that of any other Province, and
that from Burma alone the annual subvention tends
to increase. It may be admitted, as is perhaps the
case, that the settlement with Burma was made on
the same lines as those of other Provinces, that the
proportion of its revenues taken by India is much
the same as the proportion taken elsewhere. What
people in Burma feel is that this is unfair. When
our settlement was made we were still in a backward
state, ill-equipped with roads and buildings,
with many needs as yet unsupplied. Other Provinces
were far more advanced, and had less necessary
expenditure to incur. Moreover, the cost of public
works in Burma is twice as high as in other parts of
India. If, therefore, we are to be treated like other
Provinces, we ought to have more liberal terms. So
much is taken from Burma that not enough is left
for public works and other expenditure necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
our expansion. We also believe that this is a shortsighted
policy, and that liberal expenditure in Burma
would benefit Imperial and Provincial revenues alike.
Stated in few words, this is the case for Burma,
based on facts available to the public, without reference
to unpublished records.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage under which Burma labours
is the application of Indian principles and precedents.
While Burma is part of India, no doubt the system
of administration and the main lines of policy must
be the same as in other Provinces. But in details,
in matters where our conditions differ essentially
from those of India, it is unreasonable that we should
be bound by Indian rules. A Member of Council
who has never seen Burma thinks nothing of overruling<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
the Local Government on points of purely
local concern. Again, general orders framed after
consideration of the circumstances of Indian Provinces
are applied to Burma, where conditions are
totally unlike. In this way much needless labour
and waste of valuable time are caused. I remember
one Commission which contained no representative
from Burma, and which never came near the Province.
It issued an elaborate and extremely valuable
Report. For years afterwards poured forth a flood
of Resolutions on the Commission’s recommendations
which we were required to consider and discuss,
though none of them could possibly apply to our
local conditions. No real harm was done, but time
and labour were spent in vain. As Burma differs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
essentially from India, and as it is impossible that
Burma should be adequately represented in all departments
of the Government of India, the natural
conclusion is that the Local Government should
be allowed a much freer hand, and should be
trusted to know what is best in matters of local
concern.</p>

<p>While on the subject of disadvantages I may
mention a real grievance. It may seem mainly to
affect the Civil Service; really it is of vital importance
to the Province. I refer to the very small
share which Burma has in appointments under the
Imperial Government. As I myself obtained in my
service more than I could have expected, I shall not
be thought to speak from any personal feeling. In
the fifty years since Burma has been a Province she
has supplied to India one Member of Council, two
Deputy-Secretaries, one Agricultural Adviser (for a
short term), and two or three Under-Secretaries,
all within the last seven years. No civilian from
Burma has ever been chosen to administer another
Province. It does not seem likely that of civilians
in Burma, chosen in the same way as other civilians,
none has been fit for such an appointment. It is
needless to conjecture reasons for this apparent
neglect. I suggest that Burma should receive a
fair share of high offices, so that service in Burma
may cease to be unpopular, and that her needs and
conditions may be properly appreciated by the
Supreme Government.</p>

<p>During my term of office the Royal Commission
on Decentralization came to us. Needless to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
Burma had no representative among its members.
That could hardly be expected. Bombay had two
members, Madras and Bengal one each. The Punjab
and the United Provinces were omitted. Except
Mr. Dutt, a Bengali civilian who served in the
regular line and seems to have attained no special
distinction, the Commission included no one who
had any acquaintance with the system of government
by Lieutenant-Governors, and only one, Sir
F. P. Lely, who had served in a non-regulation
Province. The constitution of the Commission was
clearly reflected in the Report which regarded all
India as administered under the Presidency system,
and therefore in the hands of Secretaries and Members
of Executive Councils. The Commission learnt
little of Burma during its somewhat hasty visit.
Nor was it likely that permanent benefit would
result from the labours of a body which set out to
investigate and reform the whole administrative
system of India in the course of a cold-weather
tour.</p>

<p>The reforms of Councils devised by Lord Morley
or Lord Minto were discussed and carried into effect
during these years. These reforms were not needed
in Burma; there was no popular demand for them;
they were entirely unsuited to the Province. But
Burma must lie on the procrustean bed. I am
thankful to say, that for a time at least, the
Province was saved from popular elections. In a
country where, after thirty years, it is rare to find
Europeans or Burmans of position willing to take
an interest even in municipal elections, that would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
be the last straw. But the Council had to be
enlarged, a non-official majority secured, and the
elective system introduced at least to the extent of
enabling one body, the Burma Chamber of Commerce,
to elect<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> its member. And all the detailed rules of
procedure, of Budget discussions, of interpellations,
and the like, framed for other Provinces, have been
applied to Burma. It may safely be said that no
one in Burma is a penny the better for these innovations,
and that the great heart of the people remains
unmoved. The net result is some waste of time and
public money owing to the appointment of more
official members, worthy gentlemen who have to
spend hours in Council when they should be doing
their work. We were quite as well off under the
old Council and the old rules. The situation would
be ludicrous if it were not pathetic.</p>

<p>The objects which I regarded as most important,
and which, to the best of my ability, I pursued,
were the encouragement of efficiency in the Services,
insistence on the principle of selection to which the
Government of India often drew attention, and the
improvement of the position and prospects of officers
of various departments, particularly but not exclusively,
those manned by people of the country. I
had the pleasure of making the first appointment of
a Burman as a District Judge, my old friend Maung
Aung Zan,<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> K.S.M., being the officer selected. Two
posts of Deputy Commissioner were obtained for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
Provincial Service, the first Burman to hold that
office being Maung Myat Tun Aung, C.I.E., K.S.M.,
T.D.M. Later I appointed the first two Burman
Superintendents of Police, Maung Tun Min,<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> T.D.M.,
and Maung Shwe Tha,<a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> I.S.O., K.S.M., A.T.M.
These appointments enabled us to solve a long-standing
problem, the officering of Kyauk-pyu.
This district was notoriously unhealthy for any but
natives of the locality, so that it was difficult to
keep European officers there for any length of time.
With one Arakanese as Deputy Commissioner and
another as Superintendent of Police, both accustomed
to the climate, it was possible to have the district
efficiently administered without sacrificing anyone’s
health. For some time Kyauk-pyu was administered
solely by native officers. The experiment seems to
have been successful; both the Deputy Commissioner
and the Police Superintendent having recently been
decorated. I take the opportunity of reminding my
Burmese friends, who justly cite me as desirous of
seeing them placed in higher offices, that one
essential condition is that by character and ability
they should prove their fitness for advancement. I
am the last man in the world to wish Burmans promoted
merely because they are Burmans, without
regard to their qualifications. “After these things
do the Gentiles seek.”</p>

<p>A successful effort was made to equalize the pay
and prospects of the higher ranks of the Judicial
Service, so as to attract men of at least average<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
ability and ambition to that branch. The Provincial
Judicial Service was organized on a proper basis, so
that officers who chose or were posted to it might
receive the same pay as those on the Executive side.
The important Land Records Department was reorganized
and placed on a proper basis as regards
pay, and a system of recruitment and training was
devised. To my lot, assisted by Colonel S. C. F.
Peile, C.I.E., the experienced Inspector-General, fell
the task of introducing most of the changes following
the Report of the Police Commission. In this
matter I think we might have been allowed more
liberty to consult local conditions. After all, the
Report was not verbally inspired.</p>

<p>I had much at heart the enactment of legislation
for restraining the alienation of land and for the
protection of tenants. I was unsuccessful in effecting
either of these objects before my retirement. I
have no doubt that gradually but surely the Burman
is being squeezed off the land, and that if, as seems
likely, the proposed legislation is abandoned, the
land will fall into the hands of non-agriculturists
and natives of India. Free trade in land as in other
things may be good. From an economic point of
view the position is probably sound. More rice will
be grown for export; more land revenue and customs
duty will be garnered. But there are other considerations.
The standard of living will be lowered.
The deterioration of the Burmese race which will
inevitably accompany their divorce from the land
will be a subject for regret when it is irremediable.
Similarly, tenants in Burma are rapidly increasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
in numbers. There, as elsewhere, they need protection.
The solace of my disappointment was the
progress of the co-operative credit movement under
the fostering care of Mr. A. E. English, C.I.E.
This movement will afford a great deal of help to
the Burman cultivator. If it spreads to a sufficient
extent, it may even obviate the need of agrarian
legislation.</p>

<p>Among the pleasantest as well as the most beneficial
duties of the Lieutenant-Governor is the making
of tours in all parts of the Province. These journeys
bring the head of the local Government into touch
with officers of all grades and departments, as well
as with the people. Not the least charming incidents
associated with them are the receptions at
every halting-place of importance, where the townsfolk
offer a hearty welcome in their own fashion,
and tender loyal addresses. Some of these receptions
were elaborately and magnificently staged,
with presentation of flowers, with dance and music,
with triumphal arches, with decorated streets.
Without meaning to be invidious, I think receptions
at Mandalay, Pegu, Akyab, and Bassein, where I
was charmed to meet many old friends, stand out
in my memory as conspicuous. The addresses
presented on these occasions were often gracefully
worded. Besides a profusion of loyal sentiments
and good wishes, they usually stated matters of
local interest for which the benevolent attention of
Government was sought, the need of a new school,
waterworks, sanitation, as the case might be. In
one address my wife was gratified by being styled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
my “august consort.”<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Except the Chin Hills, the
Hill districts of Northern Arakan and Salween, and,
I am ashamed to say, Tharrawaddy, which was
unaccountably neglected, I visited all the districts
as well as the Northern and Southern Shan States.
Kyaingtôn (Kēngtūng), across the Salween, was an
object of unfulfilled desire, and a projected ride to
Namkham was not realized.</p>

<p>To Mogôk I went for the purpose of investing
the young Sawbwa of Möñgmit with the administration
of his State. At a very early age the young
Chief was taken in hand, and placed in charge of
the Rev. J. N. Cushing,<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> the venerable head of the
Baptist Mission in Rangoon, and one of the first of
Shan scholars. Dr. Cushing received him into his
own house, and treated him as a son. When of
suitable years, the future Sawbwa was sent to a
district for training in judicial and executive work.
Not till he was of ripe age, and had given evidence
of steadiness of character, was he allowed to assume
charge of his State. He received his Sanad in full
Durbar, and with it much good advice. With an
experienced Burman officer as his principal Assistant,
and under the effective supervision of the Deputy
Commissioner, Mr. E. C. S. George, the young Chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
has done well, and has shown zeal and intelligence
in the management of his State. I think the
impressions of his early years have not faded. At
the time of his investiture his marriage was celebrated&mdash;a
pleasing ceremony which I was privileged
to attend. At Mogôk the usual strenuous round of
duty and pleasure, incident to the inspection of a
district headquarters with a vigorous Deputy Commissioner,
filled days and nights. Up at six to ride
round and visit local institutions, business occupied
the day; at about five in the evening amusements
began, and lasted till the small hours. Carrying
very pleasant memories, a tired party reached
Mainglôn, on the march back to May-my̆o. Most
of the route lay along a well-graded hill-road,
aligned and made by the Public Works Officer of
Thibaw, a very intelligent Shan. At each halting-place
comfortable encampments of mat and bamboo
had been built by direction of Mr. Stirling,<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
Superintendent, and the Chief, my good friend
Saw Hkè.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>A charming tour took us the round of the maritime
districts, Tavoy, Mergui, Akyab, Kyaukpyu, and
Sandoway, in the R.I.M.S. <i>Dalhousie</i>. We cruised
in the lovely Mergui Archipelago, a summer sea set
with countless islands, rivalling in beauty the Inland
Sea of Japan. Perhaps the most noticeable sight
was Elephant Island. It stands alone, its green
slopes narrowing to the sky. At low water we
approached the shore, our boat with difficulty and
strenuous effort pushed over sands hardly covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
by the shallow sea. So we came to where the
water deepened, at the mouth of a gloomy cavern.
Entering, we found a low, winding, rock-roofed
tunnel, just wide and high enough for our boat, with
a glimmer of daylight at the far end. Emerging,
we reached the middle of the island, a still lagoon,
encircled by smooth marble walls. A magic scene
from fairyland: a snow-white ring, with an opening
like the crater of a volcano; in the midst the purple
lake. One pictured it as the secret refuge of
buccaneers, who here might hide in safety. Our
time for admiring this lovely landscape was limited;
too long a stay would have imprisoned us for hours,
till the tide fell and left the tunnel navigable.
Working by charts nearly a hundred years old, we
approached Victoria Point, the farthest outpost on
the south, bordering on the Siamese State of
Renoung. The revival of tin-mining had begun to
make the place of some importance. Later a wireless
telegraph station was established. More recently
rubber-planting has been tried.</p>

<p>After a winding course over rocks and shoals,
through unexplored Shan States and savage hills
where head-hunting is still fitfully pursued, the
Chindwin joins the Irrawaddy above Pakôkku.
Passing between banks clad with dense forest, we
desecrated with steam and smoke silent reaches
glamorous with romance. The march of progress is
gradually dissipating the mist which yet still clings
to this river of ancient story. Here and there a
court-house or a military police post marks the
advance of civilization. Inland the woodman’s axe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
resounds in the primeval forest. A coal-mine, one
of the many promising but faithless ventures of the
prospector, makes a deep cavern in a hillside. We
explored it for a considerable way by the light of
naked, guttering candles; no Davy lamps in that
mine. On the Chindwin are still current stories
with an old-world ring. There you will see a little
monastery at the water’s edge. Above that point,
though snakes abound, they have no power to harm.
On one side of the line thus marked, if a snake
bites you, prepare to die; cross the line, the same
snake may bite you with no worse effect than a
fleeting sting. Walking through a village, to test
the story we asked a man if there were many snakes.
“Oh yes,” he replied; “but, of course, they do no
harm. I was bitten yesterday.” And he showed on
his leg the mark of recent fangs. The reason of this
interesting difference is comparatively simple. Once
upon a time the countryside was ravaged by a
gigantic serpent. The King himself, in the fearless
old fashion, gave battle to the snake, and, after a
desperate struggle, slew it and cut it in half. The
two pieces he flung into the river. Now, the head-piece,
where are the poisonous fangs, floated down-stream;
the tail-piece, where there are none, floated
upwards. You see the result. If you go farther
north, you will come to a village where the people
have the fascinating power of turning themselves
into tigers. We went no higher than Homalin,
and missed the chance of verifying this attractive
legend. It was poor compensation to land at
Thangthut, the capital of a very small Shan Chief,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
to find a stack of polo-sticks in his haw,<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> and to
learn that Manipuris, the originators of the game,
sent teams to play polo with the Sawbwa and his

<p>Talking of tigers reminds me of one or two stories
which may find a place here. Real tigers are common
to many parts of the Province. One day a tiger
came upon two little girls in the jungle, seized the
younger, and was trotting off with her. The elder
sister, a girl of about twelve, took off her tamein<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>
and flapped the tiger about the face till the astonished
beast dropped the child and fled. The truth
of this story is proved by the fact that Government
gave the girl a silk tamein in recognition of her
courage and presence of mind. Another time, quite
recently, a woodman was seized by a tiger. He cut
at him with his da<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> till the tiger dropped him and
retreated. The man, enraged at being attacked,
followed and slashed him again, his only weapon
being a long wood-cutting knife. Another authentic
story, of an earlier date, tells how a tiger was killed
by a man armed only with da. We may hesitate
to believe people who tell us that Burmans are not
brave.</p>

<p>The American who declined to go to the Taj
Mahal because he had not come to India to see
tombs, when he came to Burma would not look at
Pagan because he had not come to see pagodas.
Described once for all by Sir Henry Yule in “The
Court of Ava,” in its way Pagan is one of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
remarkable places in the world. The seat of an
ancient dynasty, it lies along the bank of the
Irrawaddy below Myingyan. Pagodas, literally for
miles and in hundreds, fill the landscape as far as
eye can see. All varied styles of Buddhist architecture,
with many traces of Hindu influence, are
represented. Here is the renowned Ananda Pagoda,
among the most famous of Buddhist shrines. Here,
too, are solemn, stately figures of the four Buddhas<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
who have yet visited the earth. As the ages roll
by, other Buddhas will descend for the regeneration
of the world.</p>

<p>Not very far below Pagan, illustrative of a strange
mingling of ancient and modern, is the most productive
of the oil-fields of Burma, that of Yenangyaung.
In 1886, reviewing the prospects of mineral
discovery in Upper Burma, we prophesied before we
knew. We went nap, as might be said, on coal, and
took but little interest in petroleum. The development
of the oil-fields is the most striking feature of
the economic history of the Province for the past
twenty-five years. The search for coal has been
uniformly disappointing. The Yenangyaung field
was worked in former times by crude native methods.
Into shallow wells dug by hand men went down,
clad in a sort of diver’s costume, and laboriously
baled out oil with a bucket. The out-turn was comparatively
small. The wells were owned by a close
corporation of local Burmans known as twinzas,<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>
who had exclusive hereditary rights. All the oil ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>tracted
had to be sold to the King at a fixed price.
Of late years the oil-fields have been exploited with
all the resources of modern science by companies
who, by grant or purchase, have acquired rights
over wells and oil-bearing land. The Burma Oil
Company were pioneers of the industry. It was
under the auspices of my friend Sir Campbell
Kirkman Finlay, Managing Director of the company,
that I twice visited Yenangyaung. One of my visits
was marked by the spouting of the most productive
well yet struck in Burma. The oil-field is a busy
bustling place, covered with tall derricks and giving
employment to many drillers and mechanics. Side
by side with modern scientific extraction may be
seen the primitive native methods still practised.
Over all is a Warden to enforce the elaborate rules
necessary to safeguard the field against danger from
fire and to prevent its premature exhaustion. From
the wells runs a pipe-line conveying oil for about two
hundred and seventy-five miles to the refinery at
Syriam, where a populous town has sprung up. The
latest report gives the total quantity of petroleum
produced in Burma as 222,000,000 gallons, a very
small fraction of the world’s production.</p>

<p>Our tours on the Irrawaddy and Chindwin were
made in steamers of the Royal Indian Marine and in
the house-boat already mentioned. Among Indian
Marine officers I had many friends. One I may
mention by name, Lieutenant H. R. Bowers, was
with us on several tours. The son of Captain A.
Bowers, R.N.R., long resident in Burma, who had
accompanied Colonel Sladen’s mission to Yunnan in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
1868, he had close hereditary associations with the
Province. From the first he impressed us as an
officer of great promise, capable and self-reliant. I
bade him farewell on the eve of his departure, full
of hope and pride, for the journey whereon he died
a hero’s death among Antarctic snows. His memory
lives in the hearts of his countrymen.</p>

<p>My final tour brought me at last to the lovely
lake of Indawgyi, which I had in vain tried to reach
in 1894.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> From Hopin on the Mu Valley Railway
the distance is only some thirty miles, which we
rode leisurely in three or four easy stages. With
us were Mr. Hertz,<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> the very able and distinguished
Deputy Commissioner of Myitkyina, and Mr. W.
Scott, one of his Assistant Superintendents, whose
knowledge of Kachin language, folklore, and
customs is extensive and peculiar. Very impressive
is the panorama of the lake, lying in a semi-circle
of hills, with few traces of civilized intrusion.
A pagoda here and there on its green banks adds a
picturesque touch to the scene. We sought but did
not find the floating islands of which we had heard
long ago. Indawgyi lies on the border of a fertile
country once populous, but devastated after a
Kachin rising not long before the Annexation. It
is slowly recovering, and as population increases will
once more be a rich harvest-field. Thence we paid
a last visit to Myitkyina and the confluence.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> More
precious than the Commissioner, the Lieutenant-Governor
was not allowed to shoot the rapids. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
was induced to skirt them on a pony. Of the rise
and progress of Myitkyina I have already written.
Then for the last time, with many regrets, we passed
through the glorious First Defile and bade farewell
to it for ever.</p>

<p>It were ungracious to close this discursive record
without expressing my grateful obligations to those
who worked with me in the last responsible years of
my service. No Lieutenant-Governor ever had a
better personal staff or more capable Secretaries. If I
take leave to mention Mr. F. C. Gates,<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Mr. W. F.
Rice, C.S.I., Mr. Lionel Jacob,<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> Mr. R. E. V.
Arbuthnot, Mr. G. F. Arnold, C.I.E., Mr. F. Lewisohn
among Secretaries; Major F. J. Fraser, the late
Mr. D. Shearme, Captain A. F. S. Hill, R.E.,
Mr. C. S. Pennell, Captain E. L. Caldecott, R.A.,
among officers of the personal Staff, it is not that I
value less highly the loyalty and good service of
their colleagues. If I were to mention Commissioners,
district, and departmental officers to whom
I am indebted, I must name practically the whole
Commission and plagiarize many pages of the Civil
List.</p>

<p>So after a chequered career we bade farewell to
Burma, fairest and brightest of Eastern lands, the
memory of whose happy people will always be enshrined
in our hearts.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_180" id="Footnote_180"></a><a href="#FNanchor_180"><span class="label">[180]</span></a> A great deal of nonsense has been written from time to
time on the subject of the Burmese custom of <i>Shiko</i>. A Burman
coming into the presence of a superior, a monk, a member of
the royal house, an official, an elder of his family, adopts an
attitude akin to kneeling, and places the palms of his hands
together. Placing the palms of the hands together and slightly
raising them is the essence of the attitude of respect. It is a
charming and graceful salutation. In European schools boys are
taught to adopt instead a weird caricature of a military salute or
a debased imitation of the Indian salaam, which they do ungracefully
and with the ugliest effect. I do not care very much
for the prostration on the floor, and think it may be overdone. I
used to make people of any standing sit uncomfortably on chairs.
But what objection there can be to the hands slightly lifted in
reverence, a natural and beautiful action, why it should be
thought more dignified to pretend to cast dust on the head in
salaaming, I cannot understand. The last outrage perpetrated
in school is to teach boys to stand with arms folded across their
chests in the presence of their elders and betters.</p></div>
